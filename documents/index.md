The PCjs Library contains documentation for the various hardware and software
featured on the website.  Much of it was obtained from [bitsavers.org](http://bitsavers.org/), with additional
PC hardware resources from [minuszerodegrees.net](http://minuszerodegrees.net/) and assorted PC software documentation
from [os2museum.com](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/).

Unfortunately, we've not done a good job consistently recording where a given document (or piece of software) came from.
Going forward, we hope to be more thorough.  In the documentation displayed below, you'll now see that many documents include
a link to the original `[Source]`.  There's no guarantee that that source is definitive, or the best available, or even
still in existence; it's simply where we happened to obtain our copy.

Over the years, we've also acquired our own physical copies of software and documentation from ebay and generous PCjs users,
which we scan and post as well.  In those cases, no source link is displayed; internally, the source is recorded as "PCjs".
For example, we scanned a complete collection of [PC Tech Journal](/documents/magazines/pctj/) magazines;
someone else has since downloaded and uploaded that collection to [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/pctechjournal),
but the source is still PCjs.

## Organization

As you can see from the {% include explorer/link.html %}, each piece of documentation is filed under one of three general
areas: **Hardware**, **Software**, or **Documents**.  The idea is to have a single page for a given machine and its manuals,
or for a given piece of software and its manuals.  Anything else (ie, any document not created by the manufacturer of a
piece of hardware or software featured here) is filed under an appropriate category within **Documents**.

There are a few gray areas.  For example, there are programming books that also came with supplemental software, and in a
few cases, we have archived that software supplement as well.  So, because this is primarily a software-driven site, and to
keep related materials together as much as possible, such a book will generally be filed with its **Software**, with a
reference to the book within **Documents**.

For example, see [Graphics for the IBM PC](/software/pcx86/sw/books/graphics_for_the_ibm_pc/), which is filed under
**Software** / **IBM PC** / **Shareware** / **Books**.  However, you will also find the book referenced under **Documents** /
**Books** / **Programming**, in the section titled "[Books with Software](/documents/books/programming/#books-with-software)".
