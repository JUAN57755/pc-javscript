See the [PC Hard Drive Types](/machines/pcx86/hdc/) supported by PCjs.

NOTE: Although IBM's preferred term at the time was "Fixed Disk," the more common term became **Hard Disk**.

Why do we prefer "Hard Drive"?  Well, it's not a strong preference, but it really depends on the context.
Like floppy drives and floppy disks, fixed disks were simply the combination of a
drive enclosure (with a specific drive type) and some non-removable disk media.  So, if it makes sense to talk about those
components separately, we like to refer to the enclosure as the **Hard Drive** and the media as the **Hard Disk**.
