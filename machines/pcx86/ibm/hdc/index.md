See the [PC Hard Drive Types](/machines/pcx86/hdc/) supported by PCjs.

NOTE: Although IBM's preferred term at the time was "Fixed Disk," the more common term became **Hard Disk**.

So why are we talking about **Hard Drives** here, rather than **Hard Disks**?  Well, it depends on your focus.

Like floppy drives and floppy disks, fixed disks were simply the combination of a sealed drive enclosure containing
some non-removable disk media.  The number of heads contained in the drive, combined with the number of cylinders (tracks)
on the media, generally corresponded to a particular [*drive type*](/machines/pcx86/hdc/).

So, if it makes sense to talk about the enclosure and media separately, then we refer to the enclosure as the **Hard Drive**
and the media as the **Hard Disk**.
