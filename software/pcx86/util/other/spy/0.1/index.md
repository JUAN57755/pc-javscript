The machine below boots [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/3.31/) from drive A and then runs
[SPY](https://github.com/jeffpar/spy) from drive B.

Use '?' to get a list of SPY commands and 'g' to continue execution.  The first thing SPY will execute is an INT 19h
instruction, which will trigger a reboot from drive A.  Load another disk into drive A before typing 'g' if you want to
boot a different disk while SPY is loaded.

The [SPY Repository](https://github.com/jeffpar/spy) has more information about its history and use.
