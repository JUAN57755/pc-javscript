## Information about "NEWSBASE"

    NEWSBASE is a convenient and powerful database application to help you
    keep track of the contents of each issue of a periodical. It is great
    for publishers of journals, magazines, and newsletters, as well as
    radio and television broadcasters.
    
    Articles, descriptions, synopses, or key words and phrases are entered
    along with the column number, page number, volume, and issue date. The
    search function can then find the article related to a particular
    subject by entering a key word or phrase, or it can list all the
    descriptions of articles entered within a certain time frame. Print
    the list or save it for later use to an ASCII file.
    
    NEWSBASE is terrific for doing any kind of library research, such as
    for term papers (especially when used on a laptop). Reporters and
    editors will find it useful for keeping their "morgue" (files of old
    stories) organized and easily accessible. Whether you are an
    investigative reporter hot on a story, a bewildered publisher/editor
    needing to keep track of materials, or a student struggling on a term
    paper -- NEWSBASE will help you stay on top of the information heap.
