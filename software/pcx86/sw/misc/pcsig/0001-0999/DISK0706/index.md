## Information about "NAMEPAL"

    NAMEPAL is the complete automatic address book.  It keeps lists of
    names, addresses, phone numbers, and related comments, and prints them
    in a pocket-size "book" you can use anywhere.  NAMEPAL works on plain
    paper with any printer -- even lasers.  You can optionally print on both
    sides of each page, and you can code your data to keep track of club
    members, birthdays, babysitters, or any other grouping.  It also
    performs other handy tasks, like printing mailing labels, Rolodex card
    files, and full-page rosters.  NAMEPAL is also completely menu-driven,
    and has on-line help screens.
