## Information about "MASTERFILE DISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    Stop searching through your floppies or hard disk trying to locate
    specific files.
    
    MASTERFILE can describe the contents of a file without having to use
    the application that created the file, determine what each file is, and
    give a unique description of each file or group of files -- up to 75
    characters long.
    
    Search for your files by name or description. Print a hard copy of
    your disk library with these descriptions.
