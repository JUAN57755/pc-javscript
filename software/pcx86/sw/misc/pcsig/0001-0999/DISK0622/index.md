## Information about "RBBS-PC 4 OF 5 (212,334,621,2092)"

    The RBBS is the bulletin board system of choice for many IBM PC
    bulletin boards. It's a large system on four disks and supports the
    PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD ROM.
    
    RBBS-PC's internal structure is modularized and structured. The
    program includes a File Management System for directories, additional
    file exchange protocols, support for managing subscriptions,
    configurable command letters, multiple uploads on a single command
    line, new A)nswer and V)erbose ARC list commands, and
    context-sensitive help. It also can run as a local application on a
    network, use any field or define a new field to identify callers, and
    individualize callers having the same ID. The source code is included.
