## Information about "WORMCITY"

    For all of you who can't afford the ticket to the planet Arrakis of Dune
    fame, here is Wormcity, home of another voracious creature. Among the
    other fun BASIC games here are the Towers of Hanoi, the 15Puzzle and
    TARGET, a really decent arcade shoot-em-up (which requires a monochrome
    graphics system).  Rouning out the disk are several utilities, the best
    of which is a program for taking a compiled file back to Assembly
    (COM2ASM) and Keyflags, which lets you track your use of NumLock and
    ScrollLock in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.
    
    System Requirements: Version of BASIC.
    
    How to Start: Consult your BASIC manual for instructions on how to run
    BASIC programs for your computer.
    
    Suggested Registration: None
