## Information about "MISC. UTILITIES FOR PROGRAMMERS"

    A collection of handy utilities for programmers and computer users in
    general.  Check out the list -- there's something here for almost
    everyone.
    
    ENVED2 -- Configure the DOS environment.  Make changes more conveniently
    than using the manual SET command.
    
    PASTILS -- There are 52 various utility routines for the Pascal
    language in this source code written in Pascal.  Some of these routines:
    return the various coordinates of an active window; turn on/off reverse
    video; produce a single click from the PC speaker; calculate a loan
    payment amount; get time/date from system; get password; convert strings
    to lower/upper case; has an auxiliary device driver and serial port
    input/output; save/restore a current/previous screen; and more.
    
    87DTEC -- This utility comes with two versions of source codes to be
    compiled.  One is coded in the C language and the other in Assembler.
    Once compiled and linked, 87DTEC gives you the features, video features,
    and CPU type of your machine.  It can also determine your machine's
    compatability, illustrate timing delays, test for the presence of the
    ANSI.SYS file and the presence of a math co-processor (8087 or 80287).
    
    TC-HELP -- This program is a reference guide to the library function of
    Turbo C version 1.0.  TCHELP searches the reference guide (a file named
    TC.DAT) for the specified function, and displays the information about
    it to the console.
    
    TC10PAT -- This program reads a text from a .DIF file and applies the
    patch to the program file.  The .DIF file is relatively free-format.
    
    TPC -- TPC reads a Turbo Pascal source file and converts it into the
    corresponding C source code.  It does about 90% of the work required to
    do the translation (a macro header is included).
    
    UCTURBO2 -- This is a library that contains over 200 functions written
    in C and Assembler.  There is a wide selection of graphics functions,
    general purpose functions and functions to control the graphics dot
    matrix and a daisy wheel printer.
    
    C-WINDOW -- A special windowing-cursor control-string, character
    display and border drawing included.  Everything happens at top speed
    because C-WINDOW was written in C, converted to Assembler, and
    hand-optimized.  The C-WINDOWING TOOLBOX (C-WINDOW) programs on this
    disk perform the same function for the programming language C (Lattice C
    or Microsoft C version 3 or 4).
