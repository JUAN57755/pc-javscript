## Information about "QUEST-3D"

    QUEST-3D is a three-dimensional, wire-frame modeling program for
    designing, viewing, and editing three-dimensional objects. A vertical
    menu provides a selection of commands for many design and viewing
    tasks. Move, scale, and rotate images any way you choose for many
    creative design and illustration applications. QUEST-3D can also
    create images from any viewpoint around your image.
    
    Drawing units and rotation increments are user-selectable. Portions of
    the screen can be quickly enlarged or magnified, letting you see the
    image you are drawing. QUEST-3D also lets you scale each axis
    independently, so images can be stretched or condensed in height,
    width, or length.
