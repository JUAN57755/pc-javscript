## Information about "MR. BILL 1 OF 2 (ALSO 470)"

    Money in the bank -- a lovely phrase. Money owed to your company could
    be money in YOUR bank -- if you collect it. MR. BILL does almost
    everything needed for your small to medium-sized firm to bird dog bills
    and increase collections with a minimum of labor and losses.
    
    Highly flexible, MR. BILL handles taxes and charges of every sort. It
    automatically updates and sends client bills out monthly, prints your
    letterhead, and up to a 30-line message. You can charge different
    customers different rates for the same thing. Each file can have 16,000
    entries. Get the client's name, address, phone number, and current
    balance from the operating system in less than four seconds.
    
    Prepare itemized invoices/bills and generate a bevy of summary and in-
    depth reports including account aging and an excellent audit trail. The
    28-page manual is adequate for experienced clerks.
