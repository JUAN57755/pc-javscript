## Information about "DROEGE 2 OF 2 (ALSO 904)"

    DROEGE (Design Robot for Origination of Exacting Graphic Engineering)
    was created for designing printed circuit photomasters.
    
    DROEGE is a manual CAD system, which means it has no automatic
    functions such as schematic capture, wire listing, routing, parts
    lists, etc. It does provide the computer-aided equivalent of a taped
    master or drawing board with the advantage of always having things in
    perfect registration and the ability to work on selected layers.
    
    General features include a 65" x 65" working area, twelve layers deep,
    with a resolution of 0.001". The output can be scaled, however, so
    what is actually provided is a 65,000 X 65,000 point working space.
    Layers can be turned on and off and assigned any available color.
    Lines, pads, symbols, arcs and labels can be entered. The symbol
    feature is particularly powerful since symbols can be nested up to
    twenty levels deep, allowing the construction of very complex objects
    with a few keystrokes.
    
    Note: This program has a limited documentation file, so it will be
    very helpful if you have prior experience with CAD systems and with
    designing printed circuit boards.
