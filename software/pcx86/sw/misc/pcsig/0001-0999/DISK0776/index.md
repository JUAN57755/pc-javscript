## Information about "PSEUDOSAM CROSS ASSEMBLER 18 AND 65"

    PSEUDOSAM 18 and 65 are machine language cross-assembler programs for
    the RCA 1802, 4, 5, 6, and 6502 microprocessors.  These programs let
    you construct 1802 and 6502 code on your IBM PC, to be transferred to
    an 1802 or 6502-based system for use.
    
    The PSEUDOSAM (Pseudo brand Symbolic AsseMbler) assemblers conform to
    common syntax based on the UNIX system V assembler syntax.  The opcode
    and addressing syntax is compatible with the manufacturer's, but label,
    directive, and expression operator syntax will differ.
    
    The author of PSEUDOSAM chose this syntax because of UNIX's popularity,
    and to avoid the problem of maintaining compatibility with the many OEM
    assemblers.  The documentation is well organized and easy to understand,
    although no attempt is made to teach 1802 or 6502 programming.  You
    should have a good understanding of machine language programming and
    also be familiar with basic DOS functions.
