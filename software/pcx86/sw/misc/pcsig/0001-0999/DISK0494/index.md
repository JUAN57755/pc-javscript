## Information about "WORLD DIGITIZED 1 OF 3 (ALSO 495, 496)"

    The WORLD DIGITIZED is a compilation of more than 100,000 points of
    latitude and longitude that form the outlines of the entire world's
    coastlands, islands, lakes, and national boundaries in great detail.
    
    The data is organized by continent.  Disk 494 is required to expand the
    data to ASCII and also contains Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and South
    America.  Disk 495 contains Asia and Europe.  496 contains North
    America
    and Greenland.
    
    As distributed it is a pure database and has no programs to display the
    data.  The basic display disk is made available to those who register.
    It contains two display programs:  a user-modifiable BASIC version and a
    more advanced windowing version written in C and requiring a mouse.  It
    also contains programs to reduce the number of data points and to
    transform the data for Mercator projection.
    
    It really is a small world and now you can have it all.
