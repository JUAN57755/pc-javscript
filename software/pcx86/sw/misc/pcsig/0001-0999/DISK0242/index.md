## Information about "SAGE TRADER"

    Sage Trader was written to provide the commodity trader with an analysis
    and graphics program that would run on the IBM monochrome display.
    This program features an autosave feature that saves your data to disk
    whenever you change files or end the program. 'Typewriter' graphics are
    used, so a graphics card is not required, and graphs can be printed
    with a dot-matrix or daisywheel printer.
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type ST to enter the main program.  Consult
    TRADER.PRN for program documentation (NOTE: this program prints
    documentation directly to your printer).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $50.00
