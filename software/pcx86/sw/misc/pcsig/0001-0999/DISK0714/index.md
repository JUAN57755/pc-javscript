## Information about "COMPUTER DRAW POKER"

    Walk away from your next game a winner!  COMPUTER DRAW POKER is a fun
    and challenging program; an excellent way to increase your skill at
    poker.  It is played as five card draw poker with no requirements for
    opening bet and no limit.  Both the player and the computer start with
    1000 chips.  Each antes one chip before cards are dealt, and can raise
    the ante up to three chips per round.
    
    This program is both a player and a tutor.  It does not look at your
    hand to make its own playing descisions, and when it does check the
    cards you're holding, it doesn't remember them.  It checks your hand
    only to see that you are playing by the rules -- and tells you so when
    you're not.  It also tells you when to bet, see, raise, call, fold,
    discard, and draw.  The computer plays with a certain degree of
    sophistication and will bet high or low, as well as bluff, at random.
    When you can consistently beat the computer, you are playing with a
    good deal of skill.
