## Information about "PC-CHECK"

    A menu-driven financial system for a small business or professional
    office, as well as for personal use. Why hire a bookkeeper when you can
    do it yourself?
    
    PC-CHECK provides maintenance, with check-writing capabilities. It can
    handle multiple checkbooks and assign up to 78 payees and 100 ledger
    accounts. Sort data files, find payees, print checks, track income tax
    deductions, list data by month, quarter, payee or ledger account.
    Automatically assign the ledger account number when an assigned payee is
    selected.
    
    Let PC-CHECK take the mystery and drudgery out of financial control and
    put you back in charge -- where you belong!
