## Information about "GAME SERIES #19"

    A fine collection of arcade type games, most of which require color-
    graphics. Pinball is an absorbing video version of the old pool hall
    favorite, and MAZE, KANGAROO, and RIBIT will all keep you hopping!
    The rest of these are all equally entertaining, but BABY may not
    appeal to all tastes.
    
    System Requirements:  128K, one disk drive, monochome monitor,
    color graphics needed if file marked by a plus symbol (+).
