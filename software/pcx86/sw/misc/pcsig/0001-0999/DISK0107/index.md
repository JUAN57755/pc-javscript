## Information about "HOME FINANCE"

    Among several financial applications, the standout program is FOS, the
    Financial Operating System.  This program will maintain all your
    financial records whether they are checking accounts, savings
    accounts, CD's, stocks, bank notes, cash expenditures or just about
    any other transaction.  Many reports are available to inform you of
    your current `net worth' and to aid you in controlling your liquid
    assets.  Also worthy of note, an interesting history of the Houston
    Area League of PC Users is on the text file HAL- PC.TXT.
