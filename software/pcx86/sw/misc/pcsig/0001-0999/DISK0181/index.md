## Information about "NEWKEY"

    NEWKEY keyboard enhancer simplifies the entry of common keystroke
    sequences by letting you assign these sequences to any key desired.
    Once assigned to a particular key, whenever that key is struck the
    predefined sequence of keystrokes are returned.  For example, the Alt-C
    key combination might be defined as ``copy'' and whenever you strike
    Alt-C, the string ``copy'' is displayed.
    
    NEWKEY lets you customize software packages, readily create boiler plate
    passages, redefine your keyboard, and perform other useful tasks. You
    can even redefine your keyboard to the DVORAK keyboard if you wish.
    Several sample key definition files are included.

    ~ Ability to define almost any key
