## Information about "ABC FUN KEYS, EDUCATIONAL FOR CHILDREN"

    In our rapidly moving technological world, people are being introduced
    to the computer at younger and younger ages. ABC FUN KEYS teaches the
    alphabet, numbers, and keyboard skills to children, ages 2-6. Each
    letter is represented by colorful pictures and nursery rhyme melodies
    are played when the right key is chosen.
    
    ABC FUN KEYS has four learning games designed around the alphabet. An
    adult control panel and menu allow you to select the letters to be
    presented, the order of presentation, and many other game options.
    
    In the first game, a letter appears along with a picture of something
    that begins with that letter, and the child must find and press the key
    associated with the letter. Pressing the correct key causes the
    computer to play a song. Pressing the wrong key makes a buzzer sound.
    
    Game Two is similar to the first game, except that the picture is
    gradually revealed, slowly at first and then at an increasing rate. If
    the correct key is not quickly pressed, the picture disintegrates and
    another begins to take its place.
    
    Game Three, named Heaven and Mud, is a typing tutor for young
    children.  Letters float in the "air" in the middle of the screen.
    When the correct key is pressed, the letter explodes into hearts that
    then float to heaven.  "Unloved" letters fall and sink into the mud.
    
    The fourth game is designed for very young children. It displays the
    letter of any key that is pressed and plays a randomly-selected song.
    
    ABC FUN KEYS is educational and designed to make learning as fun and
    stimulating as possible.
