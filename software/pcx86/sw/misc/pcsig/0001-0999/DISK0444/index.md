## Information about "HOTKEY, XDOS AND EZ-MENU"

    PC/CALCULATOR turns your PC into a programmable multi-function RPN
    (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator. It features 16 visible
    memories, seven function key modes, and 14 number display formats. Run
    it in stand-alone mode or keep it in RAM. Define a "pop-up" key and
    call your calculator from inside any of your other applications.
    
    You'll always be able to add things up!
    
    Show your PC who's in charge here anyway!  EZ-MENU gives you a quick and
    easy way to run your programs while ending the clutter and confusion of
    scanning through directory and file listings.  Handle 200 .EXE, .COM,
    .BAT and .BAS programs without breaking a sweat.
    
    Have your keyboard do more of the work for you.  Program specific keys
    to perform specialized functions, enter text strings or series of
    lengthy repetitive keystrokes.  Do more computing and less typing! File
    
    A handy collection of DOS enhancements that will make your life a little
    easier.
    
    ALARM is a RAM-resident alarm clock to remind you of those important
    appointments and commitments. Go ahead and work on your application.
    This clock will call you anyway.
    
    CAT is similar to the DOS DIR command with some major exceptions:
    
    ~  CAT pauses at the end of each screen of listings and waits for a
    prompt from you before proceeding
    
    ~  Files in subdirectories are automatically listed -- down to five
    levels of directories
    
    ~  All files are displayed, including system and hidden files
    
    ~  The display is more aesthetically pleasing than DOS
    
    HELP is a text file that explains and expands on the use of DOS commands
    and syntax. Exit to DOS at any time.
    
    LOCK lets you change two of a file's attributes -- locked and hidden.
    Consider using this for sensitive or confidential information.
    
    NOPRINT lets you divert data being sent to the printer and display it on
    your monitor. Helpful when developing and testing printed output without
    using a printer.
