## Information about "HAM RADIO VOLUME 2 OF 2 (ALSO 436)"

    Ham it up!  Learn and practice your Morse with the variable speed sender
    and receiver programs.  Other routines help the amateur radio operator
    compute various electronic formulas, design antennas, locate satellites
    and calculate orbits.  RTTY and TTY are communication programs using
    Baudot, ASCII, or Morse code at varying speeds.
    
    The USAT program provides real time tracking of the OSCAR 9, 10, and 11
    and the RS 5, 7, and 8 satellites; the user specifies the date, time,
    length of time, and tracking interval.  Several programs calculate coil
    inductance, coil properties, signals for varying frequencies,
    resistance and reactance.  NETWORK provides analysis of user-specified
    circuits, to aid the amateur radio or electronic user.  The great circle
    distance between any two points is computed by GRCIRDIS when the
    latitudes and longitudes are entered.  An alphabetized list of all of
    the counties in each state can be found in the COUNTIES files.
