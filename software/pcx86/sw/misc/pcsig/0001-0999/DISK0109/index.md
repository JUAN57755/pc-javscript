## Information about "DOS UTILITIES NO 5"

    A grabbag of utilities aimed mostly at the needs of the more advanced
    programmer types among us.  BREAKPT lets you do a breakpoint within any
    program, FILEDUMP will do a hex dump to your screen.  There are
    routines to demonstrate structured macros and one on APL. One of the
    most interesting programs here is UTIL.  This is a DOS utility that
    allows you to do things like: sort directories, do paged display of
    text files, redefine your keyboard, and others.  This could be quite
    useful for anyone interested in a simple, effective way to enhance
    their system.
    
    How to Start: To run an EXE or COM program simply type its name and
    press <ENTER>.  WKS files are for use with LOTUS 1-2-3.  For
    instructions on ASM listings, refer to your Assembler manual.  To read
    DOC and read-me files simply enter TYPE filename.ext and press
    <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  UTIL $10.00, $15.00 includes latest
    version and printed documentation.
