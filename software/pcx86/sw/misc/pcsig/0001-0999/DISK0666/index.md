## Information about "SUPER BASIC PROGRAMING LANGUAGE"

    The SUPER BASIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE a.k.a. Structured Programming
    Language (SPL) is a hybrid of structured BASIC, with its easy-to-use
    commands, and a Pascal-styled architecture.
    
    This compiler takes an input source code and produces an ASCII file
    that can be executed in BASIC or compiled using the BASIC compiler. SPL
    has powerful commands that let you build of procedures, functions and
    structured programming blocks which are enclosed by BEGIN and END
    statements.  SPL has graphics ability, mathematical operators, strong
    string-manipulation commands, and the ability to handle arrays and disk
    input and output routines.
    
    It offers a way to create structured programs with a fair amount of
    ease although it is not intended for the novice computer user.  SPL
    comes with a user's manual which has an error code list as well as a
    feature index.
