## Information about "PROGRAMERS UTILITIES #3"

    This disk contains many utility programs to facilitate modeming in
    special situations.  For instance, included here is LAR, a program to
    manipulate CP/M LU format libraries.  The primary use of LAR is to
    combine several files together for upload/download to a personal
    computer.  There are also utilities for patches and ways to get around
    different problems with a BASIC Compiler.
    
    How to Start: Read the files suffixed .DOC or .TXT for directions and
    documentation.  To run any file suffixed .EXE or .COM, just type its
    name, i.e. for X.COM, type X and press <ENTER>.
