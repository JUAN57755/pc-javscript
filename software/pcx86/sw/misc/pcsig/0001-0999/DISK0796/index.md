## Information about "HOME INSURANCE"

    HOME INSURANCE lets you keep track of what you own, where items are
    located, and how much it would cost to replace any items if lost or
    stolen.  Unfortunately, most of us do not find out how much property
    insurance we need until after we suffer a major loss.  All too often it
    isn't until such a loss that we discover that our insurance coverage,
    although based on replacement value, was not sufficient to cover the
    complete loss. Or, worse yet, we discover we are unable to document the
    true value of our possessions, resulting in a reduced and sometimes
    insufficient claim return.
    
    HOME INSURANCE gives protection against these tragedies in several ways.
    First, it helps you determine whether or not you have adequate property
    insurance by comparing the actual replacement values for your
    possessions against the given limits in your policy.  For example, many
    policies limit the coverage for special items such as jewelry,
    collectibles (coins, stamps, plates, dolls, etc.), guns and furs.  You
    categorize items by type, including the total replacement value of each,
    and HOME INSURANCE lets you easily compare these amounts with the limits
    specified in your policy.
    
    HOME INSURANCE holds 10,000,000 entries, provides over 250 possible
    cross references, and is completely menu-operational.  It is easy to
    learn and simple to use.  Three user-selectable levels of operation and
    user-customized field names let you modify HOME INSURANCE to meet
    individual requirements.
