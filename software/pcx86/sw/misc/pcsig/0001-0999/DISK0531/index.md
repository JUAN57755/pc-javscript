## Information about "ALAN'S TEXT EDITOR"

    Alan's Text Editor & Spreadsheet is a full screen ASCII text processor
    program with simple wordprocessing functions, including multi-file
    capabilities.  The program is well supported with documentation and
    help menus, but does require an understanding of ASCII text editing.
    The spreadsheet is functional, but clumsy.  Sample spreadsheet files
    include balloon payments, loan mortgages and other simple accounting
    uses.
    
    System Requirements:  128K, two disk drives and monochrome display
    
    How to Start:   Load DOS and type AE to enter the ASCII editor program.
    Type AC to enter the spreadsheet program. Consult README and the .DOC
    files for program documentation.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $35.00
