## Information about "AMY'S FIRST PRIMER"

    A collection of a half-dozen games designed to teach basic skills to
    children, ages 3-8. They stress positive reinforcement and promote a
    "learning is fun" attitude.
    
    The collection includes a sing-along alphabet, a letter-matching game,
    an alphabet tutorial, a numbers-counting game, a maze game, and a
    pattern-matching game.
    
    Repeated suggestions that the parents use the games with their child
    add a nice reinforcement for family-based learning.
