## Information about "COLLEGE FOOTBALL POOL"

    COLLEGE FOOTBALL POOL is designed to make football pool games easier to
    play/follow/bet each week.
    
    A demonstration schedule is included.  Pick the week you want, and all
    the games for that week will be displayed.  Choose any fourteen games
    for the selection sheet.  The object of the game is for each player to
    try to pick the most winners of the 14 weekly games.  Selection
    sheets can then be printed showing all the players' choices.
    
    After the games are completed, enter the winning teams and print a final
    report showing the number of games each player picked correctly.  In the
    event of ties, the player who was the closest in guessing the total
    number of points scored in the last game on the selection sheet is
    declared the winner.  Up to 300 players can be handled by this program.
