## Information about "CHECKMATE"

    Keep an accurate account of your personal finances -- without all the
    hassle.  It records and maintains your checking and charge transactions
    while giving you full editing capabilities at your fingertips. It sorts
    and prints reports, searches for selected items, helps you reconcile
    your statements, and even prints your checks for you. CHECKMATE can
    also print checks and reports in any of three pitches, and reports can
    be printed in two different layouts.
    
    CHECKMATE is very intuitive. It has a user's guide and built-in,
    context-sensitive help menus.
