## Information about "MANDELBROT MAGIC"

    Fractal geometry has been used in the past to create images of many
    different subjects.  From three-dimensional pictures of landscapes to
    an accurate cross section of the heart, fractals are the wave of the
    future.
    
    MANDELBROT MAGIC generates color displays of the Mandelbrot Set, a
    famous group of mathematical structures also known as fractals.
    Fractal geometry is a complicated field in mathematics, but this
    program is easy to use and will automatically create the fractal slides
    according to your specifications.
    
    With this program you can create a new slide, or recreate a slide from
    an already existing one.  A set of fractal slides will display a portion
    of the former slide in greater detail.  Generating a slide is an
    intensive computational task and can easily take from three to 16 hours,
    but an 8087 math coprocessor will reduce the generation time by a factor
    of 10.
