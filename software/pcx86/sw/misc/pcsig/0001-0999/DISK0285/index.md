## Information about "WIZARD SCREEN"

    The WHIZZARD Screen I/O Routines are designed to allow maximum
    performance on the IBM PC.  They can be called from BASIC to increase
    the speed at which text goes to the screen.  Some of the routines will
    NOT work properly on non-IBM PCs.  In particular, the pieces that
    increase print speed for the BASIC Interpreter (See Item 3, below)
    will not operate properly with non-IBM versions of BASIC.  Try the
    software.  If it works on your configuration, great.  If not, the
    source code is on the diskette.
    
    The software on this diskette can be divided:
    
    (1)  WHIZZARD Screen I/O Subroutines. These can be called from BASIC
    to increase the speed at which text gets to the screen.
    (2)  A rational approach to calling assembly routines in BASIC code.
    This approach allows one source version for both interpreter and
    compiler input. The example uses Whizzard Screen I/O Subroutines,
    but any useful assembly routines can be added.
    (3)  Software to accelerate the PRINT statement for interpreted BASIC
    WITHOUT changing the BASIC source code.
    (4)  Software to accelerate the PRINT statement for compiled BASIC
    that uses BASRUN.EXE.  Source code is NOT changed.
    (5)  Software to accelerate the PRINT statement for BASIC compiled /O.
    Source code is NOT changed.
    (6)  Software to demonstrate BASPRINT, COMPRINT, PRSLASHO and ASMBASIC
    (7)  Patch to DOS 2.0  DEBUG  TRACE command to prevent collision between
    external interrupts (like the timer) and the TRACE command
    (8)  Software to allow editing or printing of the source and text files
    shown above despite the presence of tab characters
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and .TXT files for directions and
    documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in
    GETTING STARTED for your configuration.
