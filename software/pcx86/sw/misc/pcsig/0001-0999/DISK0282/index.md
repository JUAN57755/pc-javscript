## Information about "BUSINESS SAMPLER #2"

    The Home Financing Analyst is a comprehensive real estate evaluation
    program written from the perspective of homeowners, potential
    homeowners, or renters.  It can also assist real estate agents,
    brokers, and developers in forcasting and allocating the cost of home
    ownership and then comparing ownership, rental, and alternatives. It's
    can be used to determine if mortgage refinancing is worthwhile. The
    program can not be used to evaluate real estate purchased for
    investment purposes, as it does not take into account depreciation
    charges and rental income.
    
    PC-Check has been designed to track one or more home or office checking
    accounts.  It will allow you to create your own code file in which you
    can store up to 677 two letter codes.  The Checkbook Distribution
    program provides a quick and easy way to group credit card data or
    checks into expense catageories, handy for tracking check data entry
    and editing, balancing, and coding of entries.
    
    The CheckBook Distribution Program provides a quick & easy way to group
    check or credit card data into expense categories.  For example, check
    data may be abbreviated to just the $-Amount and a short expense Code
    for speedy data entry.  However, more complete entries, including dates
    and check descriptions, may also be used when desired.  This
    flexibility provides fast results for tax, business, or budget
    purposes.
