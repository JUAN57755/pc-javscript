## Information about "PEPSON/FASTPRT/QCKREF"

    PEPSON and PSCREEN make up a text formatting program.  Together, these
    programs allow you to enter text more or less "free-form," with
    formatting commands interspersed with the text.  It can adjust the
    lines of text (align) to any length you specify (under 71 columns)
    center lines.  It also accepts pre-formatted text (i.e., text that is
    to be printed without aligning) and allows you to change the fonts in
    the middle of a line.
    
    QUICKREF is a means of inexpensively producing a function key template
    on your printer.  This template can indicate the purpose of any or all
    of the 40 function keys for any program you desire. It allows you to
    create, update or change a template, review existing templates on the
    monitor, or print the templates. FASTPRT is a speed-up utility for the
    PrtSc function; it enables you to STOP a PrtSc operation on any
    printer.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require BASIC, EPSON-compatible
    printer.
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and .TXT files for directions.  To run
    a program with the suffix .COM, .EXE, or .BAT, just type its name,
    i.e., for FASTPRT.BAT, type FASTPRT and hit <ENTER>.  To run the BASIC
    programs, consult the directions in GETTING STARTED for your
    configuration.
    
    Suggested Registration:  FASTPRT $10.00
