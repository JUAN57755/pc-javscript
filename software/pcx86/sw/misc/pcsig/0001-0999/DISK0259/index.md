## Information about "C ADVENTURE"

    Welcome to C ADVENTURE, a classic text adventure game.  You are standing
    at the end of a road before a small brick building.  Go into the cave
    and gather as much treasure as possible without getting dismembered,
    eaten or otherwise maimed.  And, of course, escape with your loot!
    
    Since the C source code is included, the game players can explore and
    the hackers can change things to suit themselves.  Features a good
    English language parser.  Games can be saved in progress and restored
    for later playing.
