## Information about "W-ED AND WORD PROCESSING PREVIEWER"

    Dash off a letter, work on your poetry, or revise your Christmas list
    with this friendly program.  W-ED is a small, fast, and intuitive
    editor and wordprocessor.
    
    Simplicity of use was a major design criteria.  The program is based
    on the premise that sequences of often-used functions are more
    productive than many obscure hard-to-remember and arbitrary commands.
    The commands are easy to remember.  Create an ASCII file that can be
    printed or re-edited.
    File Descriptions:
    
    WED      BGN  Screens describing each section of W-ED.
    INSTALL  EXE  Changes the W-ED default options.
    WED      PGM  Describes the programmable version of W-ED.
    WED      EXE  The W-ED Word-processing EDitor (executable program).
    ORDER    WED  WyndhamWare order form for W-ED.
    WED      DEF  Documentation for W-ED (10 pp).
    WED      SAL  Sales information to obtain W-ED.
    DEMO     EXE  Demonstration of W-ED, including a tutorial.
    TSTBRD   EXE  Demonstrates the programmer's version (for DEMO only).
    WED      TUT  Screens for W-ED tutorial.
    WEREAD   ME   Short description of W-ED (2 pages).
    WED-DESC ILN  One-line description of W-ED files.
    
    See what your page layout looks like before you print your document.
    Experiment with different formatting options without printing a single
    page!
    
    The WORD PROCESSING PREVIEWING SYSTEM (WPPS) gives you a picture of
    page layouts from any ASCII wordprocessor file.  WPPS draws from one to
    18 rectangular ``pages'' on your color display and then fills them with
    output to show you exactly how your document will look when printed.
    Repeating the operation, up to 18 pages at a time, is an invaluable
    tool for saving time and paper!
    
    The previewer is especially useful when dealing with documents of
    100 or more pages, and can quickly pay for itself in paper saved.
