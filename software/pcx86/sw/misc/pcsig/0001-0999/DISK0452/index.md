## Information about "THE AMULET OF YENDOR (HACK)"

    A Dungeons and Dragons-type text adventure from the Stichting Mathematis
    Centrum in Amsterdam and converted to MS-DOS by Don Kneller.

    villains and very powerful magic, your job is to survive and prosper
    using all the skill you can muster.  Play as an explorer, warrior,
