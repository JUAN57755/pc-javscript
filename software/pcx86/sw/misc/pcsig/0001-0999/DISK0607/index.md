## Information about "TEXT UTILITIES"

    A special collection of text-processing utilities:
    
    HEBREW uses a downloaded character set on an Epson FX series printer to
    print in Hebrew, after preparing the file with WordStar.  The source
    code is provided for those who might want to change the mapping
    of English to Hebrew letters.
    
    TEXT CHECKER checks a WordStar text file for two kinds of errors:
    certain control characters, quotes, parentheses, and brackets,
    that are not in pairs; extra spaces between words and
    inconsistent numbers of spaces between sentences.
    
    CDIR -> DB is a cataloging program.  Most of the disk cataloging
    programs available impose size limitations but this one creates two
    files on the 64K, one disk drive and monochrome display disk, VOL.LIB
    and DB.LIB, and keeps appending to these as long as you keep shoving in
    disks.  CDIR is terminated after each disk read to permit you to do
    something else in the midst of doing all this cataloging.
    
    SMX is a printer utility designed for an EPSON MX80 (SFX is for the
    FX185).  It accepts a parameter (or asks for one) and then sends the
    translated codes to the printer.
    
    INDEXER creates an index file, with page numbers, from a formatted text
    file.
    
    System Requirements:  96K, one disk drive and a monochrome display;
    however, many are printer-related, so verify substitutions!
    
    How to Start:  Consult the files ending in .DOC for instructions; all
    can be printed out by entering "COPY filename.DOC prn" from the DOS
    prompt.  To run, type the filename at the DOS level and press <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  TEXTCHECK: $15.00;  HEBREW: $15.00.
