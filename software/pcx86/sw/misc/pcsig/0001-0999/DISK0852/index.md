## Information about "ASTRONOMY STAR CATALOGUE 2 OF 2 (851)"

    A valuable collection of useful programs for anyone with an interest in
    astronomy.
    
    STAR CATALOGUE lists the named and designated stars of the 88
    constellations -- generally of the sixth magnitude or brighter. Others
    of interest are included along with dimmer stars within 10 light years
    of Earth. About 1,700 stars are included in the data files. The
    statistics on each star include name, magnitude, spectrum type,
    distance, and other information. It also includes cross-referenced
    stars, whether the star is a binary, variable, or erratic variable, and
    the period of variation.
    
    CONSTELLATION 88 presents a diagram of each of the 88 constellations,
    with their general coordinates, right ascension, and declination.
    SOLAR SYSTEM gives essential facts and figures on the planets, moons,
    asteroids, and satellites within our solar system. Information includes
    distance, diameter, rotation, revolution, orbit, eccentricity, and much
    more.
    
    ASTRONOMY NOTES discusses general information concerning stellar
    astronomy such as spectral classes, Hubble's Constant, Kepler's
    Harmonic Law, and Hertsprung-Russell diagrams.
    
    CONSTELLATION NAMES lists (surprise!) the names of the constellations,
    and ASTRONOMY CONVERSIONS contains information about different systems
    of distance, temperature, and time.
