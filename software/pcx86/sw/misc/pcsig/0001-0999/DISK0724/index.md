## Information about "COUPON, EZCOUNT, AND XDIR"

    The GROCERY STORE COUPON ORGANIZER SYSTEM keeps track of grocery store
    discount coupons.  Coupons can be added, modified, deleted or just
    browsed through.  There is also a feature to delete all the coupons that
    expire before a user-defined date.
    
    Writers, secretaries, transcribers -- Count the number of words in a
    standard ASCII file.  Bells and whistles are minimal.  It counts words
    and displays how much time the program took to count.
    File Descriptions:
    
    EZREADME      Explains the rules used by EZCOUNT.
    EZCOUNT  DOC  Description of the registered version.
    EZASCII  TST  Sample ASCII file with 1200 words.
    EZWDSTR  TST  Sample WordStar file to test other word counters.
    EZCOUNT  COM  Main program.
    
    XDIR replaces the DOS commands DIR and COPY with enhanced functions, and
    adds a function that DOS forgot -- MOVE.
    
    MOVE a file from place to place in a directory or to a completely
    different directory. XDIR will move it and delete the original. You
    don't have to worry about it.
    
    Put a 65-character comment onto each file. When you copy the file, the
    comments are copied right along with it. You can even rename the file.
    You can't fool XDIR.
    
    This program is great for people who tend to use very cryptic file
    names -- now you can comment these files to remember what they were.
