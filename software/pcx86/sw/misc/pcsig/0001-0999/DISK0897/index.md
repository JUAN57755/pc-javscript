## Information about "PROMAN  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT"

    PRO MAN is a menuing program to manage access to the files and
    directories of your hard disk.
    
    Software applications can be executed from any of four pages of menu
    screens, and each file may have a password to restrict access.  You may
    require that a password be used for entering DOS or other functions of
    PRO MAN from the program.  Single files, multiple files, or entire
    directories may be automatically encrypted to secure certain programs
    when users are in DOS.
    
    Track who is using the computer system, and what they are using it for.
    Generate reports on computer access and work in a variety of parameters.
    PRO MAN also has a time clock and a video saver.  It will even park your
    hard drive's head before power down.
