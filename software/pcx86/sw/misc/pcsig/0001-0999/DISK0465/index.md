## Information about "FAMILY TIES"

    The FAMILY TIES Genealogy program is designed for the organized
    compilation of personal genealogical information.  All of the names
    entered in this program are automaticaly linked to each other.  Starting
    with one individual (usually yourself) use the edit mode to enter your
    information.  Then add a person linked to this first individual eg.
    parents, spouse, other spouse or child and enter their information.  You
    may start with any male person and then ancestors or decendants may be
    added in any order.  You may jump around and add as you please.  This
    program also does a nice job printing out a family tree.
    
    This program also has an optional mode which conforms to the preferences
    of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS) and maintains
    records according to sealings, baptisms, endowments, and temple dates.
    Other history of relatives can be entered in the record for every
    person covered.
