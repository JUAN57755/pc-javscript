## Information about "LQ PRINTER UTILITY"

    So you want letter quality, but you're stuck with that old nine-pin dot
    matrix printer?  Don't just resign, join the club; discover LQ PRINTER
    UTILITY!  It is an impressive printer utility program that lets you use
    your inexpensive dot matrix printer to print a variety of fonts in
    near-letter quality.  It can be loaded as a memory-resident program to
    filter the data from your wordprocessor or other programs, or it can be
    used alone to process individual files.  But if you have the 80K or so
    of RAM, the memory-resident mode is the most convenient way to use this
    program.
    
    LQ PRINTER UTILITY includes pre-defined fonts of Courier, Greek,
    Helvetica, Roman, and many others (italics for each font are included).
    A character editor is also provided to let you modify or create your
    own font sets.  Each font character is 10 by 24 dots so there is enough
    resolution to make some fairly decent fonts.
    
    Like all programs of this sort, LQ PRINTER UTILITY uses a graphics mode
    for your beautiful new fonts and printing takes longer -- but it's worth
    the wait.  It also provides a print spooler, and this optimizes graphics
    printing.
    
    Included is the program BIGPRINT, which lets you print large-
    letter banners (using any of the same fonts that LQ uses).  If your
    printer is an Epson (or compatible), the banner letters are made using
    the block graphics characters; otherwise, they are created with
    asterisks.  (Just make sure you don't have LQ loaded when you run
    BIGPRINT, or your printer will be running forever.)
    
    A new feature of LQ is a program that lets you create and edit your own
    letterheads.  LETHEAD is a graphics editor that works with LQ to
    produce high-resolution letterheads consisting of 1" x 1" pictures and
    up to four lines of accompanying text.
