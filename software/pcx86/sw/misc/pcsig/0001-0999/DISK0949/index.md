## Information about "STATISTICAL CONSULTANT"

    The STATISTICAL CONSULTANT is an expert system to help you select the
    right statistical test for your problem.
    
    The system asks you a series of questions about the variables and goals
    of the measurement.  Based on your responses, the system chooses a
    statistical test or measure.  Should your problem require a deeper
    analysis than can be addressed within CONSULTANT, the system indicates
    references for further study.
    
    The program assumes a level of technical knowledge greater than that
    offered in a first course in statistics.
