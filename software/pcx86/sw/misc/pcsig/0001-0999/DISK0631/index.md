## Information about "HDM IV: HARD DISK MENU SYSTEM"

    HARD DISK MENU IV or HDM is a hard disk menuing utility of the finest
    commercial quality in a shareware package.  Access and execute up to
    100,000 different programs with this utility.  HDM IV offers a
    multitude
    of features including multiple and independent menu modules with each
    having its own color and other set up characteristics, multiple levels
    of security, color and border control, mouse sensitivity, macros,
    command line arguments and the most striking ability to accomplish
    timed execution of programs; this latter feature being enough of a
    reason
    to purchase this utility!  HDM IV can be operated within about 90% of
    it's abilities without ever consulting the documentation and the only
    confusion the user may encounter is centered around the use of macros
    and switching from one menu module to another.  You will especially like
    the ability of HDM IV to execute programs at any time of day or week
    with it's "timed" program execution option.  This feature alone is
    reason enough to purchase this splendid shareware utility.  Jim Hass,
    the program author, offers various levels of licensing for HDM IV,
    beginning with a single user package rate of thirty-five dollars; the
    printed manual is an additional fifteen dollars.  HDM IV offers all of
    the features of DIRECT ACCESS, a commercial hard disk menuing program,
    and a good deal more; a substantial value for your dollar!
