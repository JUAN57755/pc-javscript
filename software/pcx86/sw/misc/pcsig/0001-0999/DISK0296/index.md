## Information about "EAMON 1 OF 4 (ALSO 297, 1038, 1039)"

    Become a character in a land of adventure and do great and marvelous
    deeds!  In this fantasy role-playing game, your first goal is to stay
    alive while getting rich during your questing.
    
    When you enter these different universes, you are no longer John (or
    Jane) Smith -- a quiet, mild-mannered computer hobbyist.  Instead, you
    are, ta-dah!, in the center of a tale of adventure -- fighting orcs,
    trolls, dragons, knights, and mages with an arsenal of weapons and
    terrible magic.
    
    An entire series of adventures await you, starting with The Main Hall
    and including Ice Cave -- sagas with all the appropriate monsters and
    traps.  The challenges are difficult, but not impossible to survive,
    and will keep you on the edge of your chair.  The monsters are very
    mean and give up their lives to stop you from getting any further in
    your quest!
