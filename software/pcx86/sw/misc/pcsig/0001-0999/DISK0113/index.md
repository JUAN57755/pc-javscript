## Information about "THREE USER SUPPORTED PROGRAMS"

    Here are three programs for system enhancement: 1) the Datamorphics
    Screen package for greater display control, 2) PC-COMPARE for comparing
    data files and; 3) DEFKEY, a keyboard reassignment program simular to
    Prokey.  All of these programs can be quite helpful in streamlining and
    simplifying your daily operations.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require a version of BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for directions and
    documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in
    GETTING STARTED for your configuration.  To run any of the programs
    with the suffix .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e., for
    COMPARE.COM, type COMPARE and press <ENTER>.
