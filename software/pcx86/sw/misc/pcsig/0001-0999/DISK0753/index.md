## Information about "SQUEEZE PRINT"

    If you're a programmer, or a writer, or anyone with a long, text-heavy
    document, SQUEEZE PRINT can help you print it in a minimum amount of
    space -- saving you paper and money.  It reads any standard ASCII text
    file and prints it without the blank lines or form feeds.  In other
    words, your document will look like one solid block of single-spaced
    text.  There are six choices of printing format, from plain 80 columns
    to 160 columns of closely spaced superscript characters.
    
    SQUEEZE PRINT is menu-driven and extremely user friendly, working
    with most dot matrix printers and some daisy type printers (only in
    one mode).  SQUEEZE PRINT comes with an option to change the printer
    codes to match your own printer.  A real paper saver!
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    System Requirements:  None.
