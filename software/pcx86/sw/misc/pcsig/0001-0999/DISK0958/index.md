## Information about "STOCK INVENTORY CONTROL"

    STOCK was created specifically for maintaining inventory control for
    businesses with a standard list of inventory items with specific order
    levels. (Businesses that stock one-of-a-kind items can use STOCK, but
    they must ignore references to order levels and year-to-date sales for
    each item.)
    
    Items are listed as individual records in the database and each item has
    an order level. The program was written in dBase III+, compiled and
    runs directly from DOS. For those who know dBase, and like to tinker,
    the source code is provided.
