## Information about "ASEASYAS"

    ASEASYAS is an enhanced and refined spreadsheet program that supports
    256 columns and 8,192 rows.  It has a high degree of command
    compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, lets you use Lotus files and includes a
    broad range of formulas and functions.
    
    Unlike many other spreadsheet programs, however, ASEASYAS can plot 11
    different types of graphs from within the program.  ASEASYAS is very
    easy to use because you enter commands through on-screen menus, unlike
    Lotus.  Other unique features include direct dBase III import/export,
    spreadsheet auditing, search and replace, macro record and playback,
    goalseeking, spreadsheet linking, and a full complement of macro
    commands.  There is also a linked calculation sequence that saves
    considerable time when recalculating.
