## Information about "GT POWER 2 OF 4 (ALSO 782,1549,1550)"

    GT POWER is an example of telecommunications at its finest.  An easy
    set-up routine and quick simple-to-use commands make communicating with
    other computers and BBSs a snap.  GT POWER is a set of programs and
    files that provide complete capabilities for your system. Designed for
    use on IBM/compatible micro-computers, it supports a wide variety of
    modems including all Hayes compatibles, USRobotics, and IBM.
    
    Just a few of the features you will find on GT POWER are:
    
    ~ ANSI standard terminal emulation
    
    ~ ANSI.SYS style color graphics, without the need of ANSI.SYS!
    
    ~ Multiple telephone directories with 999 entries each. Records the
    password for each BBS, as well as the date and time of last contact.
    The total number of calls, accumulated time, uploads and downloads are
    also recorded.
    
    ~ Numerous protocols are supported, such as: SEAlink, Xmodem/CRC,
    WXmodem, Ymodem/CRC, Telink/CRC batch file, the CompuServe "B"
    protocol and more.  Also, ten slots for external protocols to be added
    by the user.  GT comes with several of these slots pre-setup for the
    most popular protocols; i.e., Zmodem, Ymodem-G, Kermit, Jmodem,
    Super8k, and BiMode. These can be changed easily or added to, by
    modifying the External Protocol Table in the GT configuration.
    
    ~ ASCII file transmission, using XON/XOFF protocol and/or line-by-line
    pacing and/or inter-character delays.
    
    ~ Full control of all communication parameters.
    
    ~ 40 function keys, to store logon, passwords, etc.
    
    ~ Full printer support, using XON/XOFF flow control with the host.
    
    ~ DOS Shell. Exit to DOS and return, GT stays in the background.
    
    ~ Interactive script language, to automate many repetitive tasks.
    
    ~ Optional LOG file. Keeps a complete record of your calls.
    
    ~ Detects BUSY, VOICE, NO DIAL TONE, and more, with modems that support
    extended result codes, such as the USRobotics Courier 2400 Modem.
    
    ~ On-screen clock, so there is no need for a memory-resident clock
    program.
    
    ~ Host mode. Allows user to set up a system to accept incoming calls.
    
    ~ Support for the non-standard COM ports: 3 and 4.
    
    A comprehensive Help menu is available at any time.
