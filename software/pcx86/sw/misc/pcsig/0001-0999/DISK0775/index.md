## Information about "PSEUDOSAM CROSS ASSEMBLER 68 AND 685"

    PSEUDOSAM 68 and 685 are machine language cross-assembler programs for
    the Motorola 6800, 01, 02, 03, 08, and 6805 microprocessors.  These
    programs let you construct 6800 and 6805 code on your IBM-PC so
    it can be transferred to a 6800 or 6805-based system for
    later use.
    
    The PSEUDOSAM (Pseudo-brand Symbolic AsseMbler) assemblers conform to
    common syntax, based on the UNIX System V assembler syntax.  The opcode
    and addressing syntax is compatible with the manufacturer's, but label,
    directive, and expression operator syntax will differ.
    
    The author of PSEUDOSAM chose this syntax because of UNIX's popularity,
    and to avoid the problem of maintaining compatibility with the many of
    OEM assemblers.  The documentation is well organized and easy to
    understand, although no attempt is made to teach 6800 or 6805
    programming.  The user should have a good understanding of machine
    language programming and also be familiar with basic DOS functions.
