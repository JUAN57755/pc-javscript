## Information about "CHILDREN'S WORD"

    WORD PROCESSING FOR KIDS (WPK) is a simple word processor especially
    designed for children, ages 5-10.
    
    WPK was developed to help children build communication skills, develop
    computer expertise and make writing not only possible, but fun! In a
    distinctively bright and friendly environment, it features graphic
    menus, word wrap, and extra large characters -- making it less
    intimidating and easier for the little ones to read. The on-line help
    function takes only a few moments to master. Well-written and
    thorough documentation completes the package for the budding author.
