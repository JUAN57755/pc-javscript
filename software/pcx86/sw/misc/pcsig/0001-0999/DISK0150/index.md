## Information about "IBM BBS"

    A simple, straight-forward BBS written especially for the IBM PC. The
    code is compiled BASIC.  Both the source and executable versions are
    provided so you can run it as is or modify it.
    
    It is a reasonably powerful system with a lot of thought and experience
    behind its design.  However, it has been around for awhile and many of
    the newer BBS offerings surpass its capabilities by quite a bit. This
    system, for example, handles only one line at a time.
    
    System Requirements: Two drives, one serial port, modem, BASIC
    
    How to Start: Documentation is spread out in files marked .DOC (for
    DOCument) and .HLP and plenty of simple text files.  To run IBBS.EXE,
    type IBBS and hit <ENTER>.
