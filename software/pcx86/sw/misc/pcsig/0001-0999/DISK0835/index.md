## Information about "MULTIFILE"

    MULTIFILE is a memory-resident database program designed specifically
    for mailing labels, membership files, or small inventories.
    
    It is a small, versatile, menu-driven database that can arrange your
    data into from one to six equally-spaced columns. These can then be
    used for lists, mailing labels, envelopes, or printouts on paper for
    windowed envelopes. Columns can be sorted so data will appear in
    alphabetical or numerical order. The totals for each column can be
    calculated and printed. Other corresponding columns can be sorted by
    one particular column.
    
    Delete, edit, or search for a particular entry. Each file can be saved
    or loaded from the disk. Two sample files are included to help you
    become familiar with the program.
    
    MULTIFILE handles up to 500 records in memory and prints standard 3.5"
    one-across labels. You can also define the print format for odd sized
