## Information about "QCHECK3 CHECK ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    QCHECK3 -- Creative Resources's checking account management system is a
    menu-driven program, which is set up to minimize the errors, and ease
    reporting of data on any checking account, either personal or small to
    medium size business.
    
    Menu selections include new check/charge entry, deposit entry, check
    cancellation, deposit cancellation, balance inquiry, screen listing of a
    portion or all of the check register file, listing of all uncanceled
    items, editing of any item, creation of a new register, a variety of
    reports on check and deposit activity, and a means of restarting the
    program for a different check register data file without the need to
    exit to the operating system. Also includes several DOS utilities for
    free disk space, free memory, etc.
    
    QCHECK3 has the ability to export data to an electronic spreadsheet (PC-
    Calc, SuperCalc, Quattro, Lotus 1-2-3, etc.). It also provides for user-
    defined check memo code suggestions, user-defined function key macros
    for "pay to" entries, user-defined printer set-up strings, a handy
    calendar function for date look-up, and checks for adequate disk space
    prior to actions requiring more space.
