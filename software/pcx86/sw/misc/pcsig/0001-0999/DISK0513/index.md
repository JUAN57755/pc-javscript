## Information about "B MENU AND MENUGET"

    BMENU allows simplified development and use of command menus. The menu
    files are built with a text editor, using an abbreviated and simple set
    of commands. Anyone who can use a text editor can use this system.
    
    MENUGET is another program to incorporate menus into batch files. The
    disk comes with a set of demonstration programs and menus. The
    documentation is sparse, but adequate.
    
    One of the demonstration programs, DATIME.EXE, is very functional as it
    allows you to set the system time and date on a single line in a variety
    of time/date formats. You should add this one to your system's utilities
    
    This is a nice program, one that should simplify using the computer for
    people who don't want to learn DOS in detail, and don't want to pay the
    higher price of most commercially-available menu programs.
    
    System Requirements:  None.
    
    How to Start:  Type MENU (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00
