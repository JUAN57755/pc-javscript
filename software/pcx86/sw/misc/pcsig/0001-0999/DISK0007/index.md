## Information about "EXPLIST"

    Here are four of our earliest user-supported programming aids. EXPLIST
    (for Expanding Lister) is the most powerful, giving a structured code
    look to BASIC listings.  It does this by adding blank lines between
    specific keywords (GOTO, NEXT, etc); FOR...NEXTs and WHILE...WENDs are
    indented; and nested loops are indented even more.  REMarks are
    highlighted in several ways. PRINT works with EXPLIST to print the
    listings with title headings and page numbers.
    
    BIHEX converts any file to ASCII (7 bit) for modem transfer or printing.
    LF prints a directory alphabetically with the post script on the right
    of the list, and all names associated with that post script grouped to
    the left of the list.
    
    System Requirements: 64K, one disk drive and monochrome display.
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for directions and
    documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in
    GETTING STARTED for your configuration.  To run a program with the
    suffix .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e., for LF.EXE, type LF and
    press <ENTER>.
