## Information about "CORBIN HANDBOOK 2 OF 2 (ALSO 616)"

    This disk is the first of a two disk set containing the Corbin Handbook
    of Bullet Swaging, No. 7 written by Dr. Corbin.  This one has the
    table of contents and the first 11 chapters.  It is saved in ASCII text
    format.
    
    The subject of bullet swaging is the manufacture of projectiles using
    high pressure to flow ductile metals at room temperature into the
    precise dimensions of a strong, highly-finished steel die.  The process
    is discussed both as a hobby for the firearms enthusiast and as a
    highly profitable part-time business venture, supplying handloaders
    with high quality, special purpose bullets.  Utility programs on this
    diskette facilitate the retrieval of the Corbin Handbook information.
    
    System Requirements:  64K, one disk drive, a monochrome display and an
    ASCII text editor or word processor.
    
    How to Start:  Consult the READ.ME and INTRO.TXT for directions.  To
    run, prepare two formatted disk with the DOS system command and add
    files FIND.EXE and ANSI.SYS; copy 616 to one and 617 to another using
    the COPY *.* command.  Either can now be run by placing in A: and
    hitting CRTL-ALT-DEL and following the access menus that then appear.
    
    Suggested Registration:  The handbook is available in a bound, printed
    book format for $4.00 by ordering directly from Corbin Manufacturing &
    Supply.
