## Information about "SORTED DIRECTORY AND FLIST / PC"

    SDR.COM provides more information than the resident DOS DIR command
    about the files on a disk, and lets you select, sort, format, and
    display the information in a variety of ways. You can specify a
    pattern name to select the desired files and by specifying any of a
    variety of command line switches. The default switch values have been
    carefully chosen to reflect their most common use, and for
    compatibility with the standard DIR command. Select files by
    attribute, age, or string match. Sort on any directory field. Global
    disk directories can be searched for files matching the specified
    criteria.
    
    Use in stand-alone mode or as memory-resident. It is possible to use SD
    in an almost infinite variety of ways by using the switches in different
    combinations. Designed to be as transparent as possible in normal
    operation, it does not impose itself between the user and the operating
    system. Novices or experienced users both can profit from this utility.
    
    FLIST/PC is a selection menu for manipulating your files in a more
    efficient manner.
    
    Copy, move, rename, delete, edit, and execute a file by simply
    indicating the desired action. Multiple actions can be executed with a
    function key. FLIST/PC can be used with your own word processor or
    text editor without exiting FLIST/PC. The disk file directory can be
    sorted by filename, extension, size, or date. You can easily scroll
    through a directory, display the tree structure of all subdirectories
    on the current disk drive, and select new paths and directories to be
    displayed.
