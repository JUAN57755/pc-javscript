## Information about "MIT / ISI COMM GROUP"

    This is a serial I/O package originally developed by John Romkey and
    Jerry Saltzer of MIT. It is fully interrupt-driven on transmit,
    receive, and error detection.  It will run at 9600 baud, and even
    faster if you don't plan on doing anything else.  Both the complexity
    and flexibility of this package come from its ability to support
    multiple operating systems, languages, and address sizes.
    
    System Requirements: Two disk drives, an assembler and a C
    compiler.
    
    How to Start: From DOS, enter TYPE README for the disk's menu.  Enter
    TYPE COMMMSGS.DOC for details about the MIT/ISI communications package.
