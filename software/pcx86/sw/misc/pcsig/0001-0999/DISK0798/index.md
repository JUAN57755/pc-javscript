## Information about "PRO-MENU"

    If you're one of those people who wishes there was some easier way of
    telling your computer how to do its job beside typing in DOS commands,
    PRO-MENU is for you.
    
    PRO-MENU is a complete menuing system that goes beyond choosing your
    application from a single main menu.  PRO-MENU lets you to program
    prompts to automatically come up after a menu selection.  For example,
    selecting the option "Print a File" may be followed by the prompt
    "Which File?"  You can also add comment lines to separate groups of
    commands from a menu.  In addition to the single line description on
    the actual menu you can add informational text files that appear once a
    menu selection is made.
    
    PRO-MENU also lets you execute DOS commands from plain English text on
    the menu screen.  For example, by selecting "Prepare disk in drive B"
    from the menu screen, PRO-MENU can execute the DOS command "FORMAT
    B:/S."  This is a particularly nice feature of the program.
    
    With a hard-disk system, PRO-MENU can be arranged into separate
    submenus, each customized for a different application or for different
    users.  PRO-MENU supports any number of submenus and can handle as many
    as you wish.
