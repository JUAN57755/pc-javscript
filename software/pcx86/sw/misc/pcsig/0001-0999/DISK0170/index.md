## Information about "SPREADSHEETS"

    Spreadsheets is actually FreeCalc version 1.01, which is a reasonably
    good Lotus clone.  However, many of the bugs and limitations present
    in this program are removed in version 2.0, which is available on Disk
    #574.  The Pad (PC-PAD) is an interesting calculator and spreadsheet
    that can be used with FreeCalc worksheets.  Both FreeCalc and The Pad
    are menu driven and fairly easy to use, but the documentation
    (provided) is important to read.  The spreadsheet itself is 100 rows
    by 25 columns wide.  Another odd utility program is Minicalc, which is
    a small compiled spreadsheet.  Minicalc is interesting to look at, but
    not very useful.
    
    System Requirements: Two disk drives, BASIC
