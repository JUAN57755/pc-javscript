## Information about "CHASM  (CHEAP ASSEMBLER)"

    CHASM (Cheap Assembler) is a prime weapon for programmers who want to
    learn to program in Assembly language.  The program comes with clearly-
    written documentation and has a tutorial built in for users lacking
    detailed experience with Assembly language.
    
    CHASM is a compiler only and there is no editor included.  You use an
    ASCII word processor to create your source code file, then use CHASM to
    compile it.
