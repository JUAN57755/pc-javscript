## Information about "FLASH CARDS 2 OF 4 (367, 369, 370)"

    A menu-driven 7,500-Word Vocabulary Builder and Spelling Teacher for the
    high school and college-level student.  The flash card format has proved
    to be an effective teaching mechanism for improving spelling and
    vocabulary skills.
    
    The dictionary does not include the 4,000 most basic words but, rather,
    the 7,500 next most commonly-used words.  BASIC source code is included.
    While you're polishing your spelling, learn the parts of speech and the
    definition of each word.
