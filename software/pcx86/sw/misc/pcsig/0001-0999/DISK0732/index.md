## Information about "TRACKER AND CATCHER FOR THE BLIND"

    TRACKER is a general-purpose income/expense tracking program written for
    the visually-impaired.  The program is designed for use with a speech
    synthesizer, to vocalize information usually read from the screen.  The
    documentation has internal help screens for each of the program's
    commands.
    
    CATCHER is an interesting twist on an old theme.  The object is to catch
    falling characters with a paddle at the bottom of the screen.  The twist
    is the program was written for visually-impaired people and is designed
    for use with a speech synthesizer.
