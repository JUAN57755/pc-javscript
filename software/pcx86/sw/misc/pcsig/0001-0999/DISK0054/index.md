## Information about "XMODEM"

    XMODEM is a communications program that imposes no restrictions on
    the contents of the data being transmitted.  Any kind of data may be
    sent-- binary, ASCII, etc.
    
    This IBM Asynchronous Communication Support Program provides software
    needed to allow the personal computer to communicate with a wide variety
    of computer systems including several IBM mainframe computers.  It
    emphasizes great flexibility in communications and provides a protocol
    for file transfer between personal computers.
    
    The user must be technically competent in communications protocol to be
    able to properly set selectable  parameters provided through various
    menus.  A user-friendly design has been substantially ignored.
    
    Features:
    ~ A 64K version named SHORTERM.BAS, and a 96K version
    named LONGTERM.BAS
    ~ Automatic selection of screen width and an option to
    bypass all intermediate menus
    ~ Preselected parameters for Display Selection and Dialing
    Option for the Hayes Smartmodem
    ~ Download capability, including error trapping, file
    directory printout, On/Off switching of data recording
    for open files, and status indicator
    ~ Upload capability, including error trapping, file directory
    printout, On/Off switching, status indication
    ~ Time/Date/Status line
    ~ Telephone/LOG-ON menu and function
    ~ Automatic enabling of error messages upon terminal startup
    ~ Error trapping routines supported in many areas for printer
    applications
    ~ Changes to preset terminal parameters, facilitating program
    initialization in full duplex mode and bypassing of menus.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require BASIC; two disk drives,
    modem
