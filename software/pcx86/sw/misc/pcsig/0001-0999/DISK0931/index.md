## Information about "SPEEDY MAILER JR. MAILING LIST"

    SPEEDYMAILER lets you keep track of a list of people with their names
    and addresses, allowing you to get rid of that old address book you
    keep forgetting to update.
    
    This program can be useful for maintaining lists of clients, group
    members, magazine or newsletter subscribers, as well as numerous other
    applications.  Data within your list can be sorted in a number of ways:
    by name (either the person's last or first name), city, state, and
    zipcode.  In addition, SPEEDYMAILER provides for two "code" fields
    which you can use to further differentiate between entries in your
    database.  Additional fields are also available for title, company,
    entry date, edit date, and CarRt sort.
    
    Output from SPEEDYMAILER comes in a variety of different formats.  It
    prints out labels in two different sizes (4" x 1-7/16" and 3-1/2" x
    15/16").  It also prints your names list on two sizes of Rolodex cards
    (4" x 2-1/6" or 3" x 5").  The program performs well in all of its
    intended functions, and is a fine mailing list program which should
    serve well for smaller lists.
    
    One last note: the version of SPEEDYMAILER on this disk is an
    evaluation version only.  It holds a maximum of twenty names and no
    more.  In order to get more capacity, you must send the registration
    fee directly to the author for the full version of the program.
    
    System Requirements:  384K memory and a hard disk.

    Suggested Registration:  $40.00
