## Information about "PC-MONEY"

    PC-MONEY is a program designed to maintain personal, family, and small
    business financial and tax records. It includes a module that keeps
    records for a home business, and a module that consolidates tax
    information from personal and home business tax records and then
    estimates federal income tax liabilities.
    
    PC-MONEY makes it possible to keep records for as many as nine bank
    accounts. It also maintains an annual tax account which includes up to
    44 categories for easy consolidation and compilation of like items for
    income tax estimating or preparation. Entries such as checks or
    deposits that affect both a bank account and your tax account are made
    in a single entry. Bank and tax records can be displayed (and printed)
    a number of different ways. All operations are selected by menus that
    are easy to use. All account data is entered via fill-in forms with
    editing capabilities.
