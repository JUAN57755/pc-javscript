## Information about "TWO FORTHS"

    Here are two FORTHS that are ready for the beginner to use.  They also
    include the documentation and source code for experienced programers
    who want to extensively expand or modify their FORTH.  Good examples
    for those who want to write their own FORTH engine are provided in the
    assembly language source files.  MVPFORTH and FORTH-H can be assembled
    using IBM's assembler.
    
    System Requirements: MVPFORTH and FORTH-H source files can be assembled
    IBM's assembler, but FORTH requires the Seattle Computer products
    assembler.
    
    How to Start: Read the accompanying .DOC file.  To start MVPFORTH: type
    MVPFORTH to load the MVPFORTH operating system from DOS.  Then typing
    VLIST will list the available FORTH words (FORTH-79 compatible ).
    
    File Descriptions:
    
    MVPFORTH DOC  Documentation for MVPFORTH
    MVPFORTH WDS  List of code level words for MVPFORTH
    MVPFORTH ASM  Source code for MVPFORTH IBM assembler format
    MVPFORTH COM  FORTH-79 compatible forth interpiter
    FORTH-H  DOC  Documentation for Glen Haydon's FORTH
    FORTH-H  COM  Glen Haydon's FORTH interpreter
    FORTH-H  ASM  Source for Glen Haydon's version of MVPFORTH
