## Information about "MEALMATE"

    On a diet?  Need some help?
    
    MEALMATE is a planning aid for preparing meals for people on a carefully
    controlled diet.  Although primarily designed for those 10% of us who
    are diabetic, it can be a big help to anyone preparing meals that have
    to meet strict requirements for calories, proteins, carbohydrates and
    fats.  In today's health and nutrition-conscious society, that means
    everyone including you and your family.
    
    Combine information from meal plans or menus to verify the total
    nutritional content of a meal.  Can't look another head of lettuce in
    the eye?  Help is provided to plan more varied meals and to choose
    substitutes for disliked or hard to find items.
    
    Let's face it.  Nothing's going to make a diet fun but at least you can
    get help with some of the more dreadful aspects.  MEALMATE is easily
    operated and presents nutritional information on many common foods.
    
    Pass the salad, please.
