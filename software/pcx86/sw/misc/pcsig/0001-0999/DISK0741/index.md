## Information about "PURCHASE ORDER SYSTEM"

    PURCHASE ORDER SYSTEM is great for almost any kind of business. It
    makes it easy to enter and print purchase orders, and keep a record of
    all vendors. You can enter a list of vendors with addresses and phone
    numbers, which you can later browse, edit, or delete. And you can print
    a vendor master list.
    
    When entering a purchase order, the screen is divided into several
    columns for the account number, quantity, unit, item description, and
    price. Outstanding purchase transactions can be printed by account,
    vendor, or purchase order. Purchases received can be cleared
    immediately, and if a purchase transaction is accidentally cleared it
    can be uncleared for recall.
