## Information about "BUSINESS SAMPLER #1"

    Here is an organizer for the home and office.  A perfect example is
    The Personal Datebook, a menu driven program that maintains a daily
    calendar of appointments, birthdays, memos, events and anything else
    you want to record.  The Address Label System is an address data entry
    system for producing and maintaining customer files, address labels,
    and mailing lists.  It's especially useful for capturing large volumes
    of names and addresses for direct mail advertising.  The combined Cash
    and Hardcash programs are intended to track cash flow transactions.
    This is a simple general ledger which provides a convenient method for
    small businesses to record their cash transactions.
    
    System Requirements: Some programs require BASIC, 2 disk drives
    
    How to Start: Consult the .TXT and .DOC files for directions and
    documentation.  NOTE: Mailing Label program which requires BASRUN.EXE.
    To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in GETTING STARTED
    for your configuration.  For the .EXE and .COM programs, just type its
    name, i.e., for FILEMAN.COM, type FILEMAN <ENTER>.
