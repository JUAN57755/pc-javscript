## Information about "HOST-III PUBLIC BBS"

    The HOST-III communications package, while designed for private
    remote-to-host type file transfers, can be used as a public BBS.
    HOST-III automates the RECEIVE end of any file transfer, allowing
    unattended operation of the host.  HOSTCALL automates unattended file
    transfers for late-night, low-rate use.
    
    HOSTCALL can also initiate telephone calls to host computers (such as an
    IBM-PC running HOST-III) and exchange files based on the commands in
    what is called a Command File.  The host computer may or may not be an
    IBM-PC.  You create the Command File which contains the information
    HOSTCALL needs, such as the time to call a host system, the telephone
    number, and the names of the files to exchange.  A single COMMAND FILE
    can sequentially access a number of host computers.  Both programs
    support the XMODEM protocol of file transmission.
    
    While this is an older program and does not have some of the features of
    the more up-to-date models, is is also considerably less complicated to
    set up.
    
    Special Requirements:  Two disk drives and Hayes Smartmodem or
    equivalent.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $35.00
