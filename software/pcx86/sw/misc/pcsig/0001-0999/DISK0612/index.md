## Information about "LANGUAGES"

    LANGUAGE TEACHER is a series of menu-driven language tutorial programs
    for vocabulary, verb conjugations and standard phrases in French,
    Spanish, German, and Italian.  HEBREW is a separate program for
    language-skills development.
    
    Each lesson is a self-paced tutorial in that specific language. Hundreds
    of word combinations and thousands of verb conjugations are provided.
    Various tests are presented including multiple choice and diagnostics.
    Questions and word choices are randomly selected.
    
    These lessons are not designed to teach conversational languages but
    rather to provide drills in order to increase your working vocabulary
    and practice your use of the conjugation forms.
