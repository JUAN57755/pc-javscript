## Information about "HGCIBM-COLOR EMULATION FOR HERCULES"

    If you're the owner of a computer with a Hercules monochrome graphics
    adapter card, and have been lusting after a nice piece of color graphic
    (CGA) software, but can't run it because of your current computer set-
    up, this software will solve your problems.
    
    HGCIBM provides owners of Hercules graphics cards with a means to run
    software written for the IBM Color Graphics Adapter.  You need no
    additional hardware to run this emulator -- HGCIBM works by ``tricking''
    programs into thinking you have a color card when you don't.
    
    With HGCIBM, a color program won't shut itself down but instead, will
    continue to send video output to your monochrome screen.  This program
    is one of the few ``must-own'' programs for all Hercules users.
