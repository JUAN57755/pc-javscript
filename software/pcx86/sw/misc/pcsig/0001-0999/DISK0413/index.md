## Information about "DOS UTILITIES #19"

    This disk is chock full of very useful sets of utility programs and
    systems that enhance and simplify the sometimes obscure MS/PC-DOS oper-
    ating system command structure. There are also utility programs that
    provide functions that are not available in 'plain vanilla' DOS.
    
    System Requirements: 64K memory and one disk drive (some programs
    require color graphics).
    
    How to Start: Type: FILENAME (press enter) to start a program. FILENAME
    is equal to the name of the program that you want to run, for
    example: to start the program 1DIR, type: 1DIR (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration: Various amounts.
