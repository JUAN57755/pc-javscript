## Information about "WALMYR PROGRAMS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 649)"

    This disk has three demonstration programs. The WALMYR DISK PROTECTOR
    can prevent unauthorized peolple from gaining access to your computer.
    Upon boot-up, the program will ask for the password. After three
    incorrect attempts, the program sounds an alarm and prompts the user to
    turn off the computer. The program is not fool-proof, but is designed
    to keep out casual intruders. This demo of the program lists the
    password on the opening screen, but it is removed upon registration.
    WALMYR PEN PAL lets you conduct private communications with another
    person. It can administer questionnaires and interviews, as well as
    handle letters. The full version encrypts all correspondence, but in
    this demo any person can read all the text files. WALMYR BOOK
    MAKER lets you integrate separate ASCII text files into one formatted
    and consistently-paged document. In the full version of the program,
    the size of the printed document is unlimited. The demo version of this
    program is limited to 25 pages.
    
    The WALMYR TEACHING ASSISTANT is for teachers, designed to automate
    test taking and grading, and thus reduce the amount of time it takes to
    prepare a course. It can prepare random quizzes from a pool of
    questions, administer quizzes, and grade each quiz for each student.
    You only need write the quiz once, and after that the program takes
    over. You can specify the number of times the students may retake a
    quiz. The program can prepare final grade reports, let students check
    their grades, and print graphs of test scores. It can also display and
    print text files, such as lecture notes, course syllabuses, notices,
    etc. The teacher has a master disk from which the course format is
    designed, while each student's record is kept on his own individual
    disk. Grades are collected by having the students turn in their disk
    after a number of exams or quizzes are completed. The master disk takes
    all data and updates the teacher's records. All records are password-
    protected, so a student's records can only be examined by the
    teacher and that student.
    
    The WALMYR INDEX OF TEACHING ABILITY analyzes a group of students'
    evaluations of the teacher's performance, based upon a questionnaire
    that comes with the program. It produces both an actual and adjusted
    report. The adjusted report is produced after the program eliminates
    students who scored lower or higher than the class average, both on an
    item as well as on a total-score basis. The program provides a report
    that shows the mean, range, and standard deviation, a count of students
    who graded higher or lower than normal, a count of total students who
    rated the course, and an estimate of how consistent the data is.

    printer is optional for WALMYR BOOK MAKER.
