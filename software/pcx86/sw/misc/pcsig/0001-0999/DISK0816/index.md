## Information about "TURBO C TUTORIAL 1 OF 2 (ALSO 817)"

    If you are a programmer in C or other programming languages and have
    been thinking about moving up to Turbo C, TURBO C TUTORIAL can help
    open the door.
    
    TURBO C TUTORIAL will teach you the basic structure of the C
    language.  Turbo C is not really a beginner's language and the author
    assumes you are familiar with some other programming languages but know
    nothing about C. The tutorial starts by explaining the C language and
    by the time you have completed the lessons you should be very familiar
    with Turbo C.
    
    Included are over 60 C source code files, which are to be used
    with the tutorial.
