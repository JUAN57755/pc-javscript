## Information about "LIGHTWAVE UTILITY DISK"

    LIGHTWAVE UTILITIES is a large collection of useful programs; some are
    quite uncommon. WHERE looks in all the directories of a specified drive
    and reports where a filename occurs. LS and DR both give sorted
    directories listed in column form, but DR also includes file size
    information.
    
    The other seven utilities are in BASIC, and they include the source
    code. They will:
    
    ~ Show you all the screen attributes of your screen
    
    ~ Show you all the screen characters
    
    ~ Find all the active memory in your PC
    
    ~ Tell you when your BIOS chip was designed
    
    ~ Tell you when your BASIC chip was designed
    
    ~ Show you the keyboard status bits
    
    ~ Perform percent-change calculations from one month to the next.
