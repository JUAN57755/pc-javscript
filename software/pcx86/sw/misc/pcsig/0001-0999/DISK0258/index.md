## Information about "COMMUNICATION NO 3"

    This disk includes an assortment of communications programs and
    utilities.  HC.COM is a Hex File converter which converts to and from
    HEX format.  It can automatically provide a COM or EXE extension.
    TALK.EXE is a simple terminal emulator.  RING.BAS will set up the
    HAYES to patiently look for an incoming ring, and turn SYSTEM control
    over to the caller.  SCRIPT.DOC is a procedure to set up a menu
    processing system for Crosstalk.  Included are procedures to perform
    automatic logon and capture to the IBMSIG which may be extracted and
    used as stand-alone Crosstalk scripts.  SERIAL.COM inserts itself into
    memory below command.com ,and changes the ROM bios interupt vectors
    for RS232 I/O to use interupt driven I/O.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC files for documentation and
    directions.  To run the BASIC programs follow the GETTING STARTED
    instructions for your configuration.  Programs suffixed .COM or
    .EXE run from DOS by typing <filename> <ENTER>.
