## Information about "REIPS, THE SIMPLE BOOKKEEPER, TYPERITE"

    Real estate professionals -- evaluate prospective real estate
    investments and keep track of them for your clients.
    
    Evaluations are based on measurements produced by REIPS, such as the
    financial management rate of return, internal rate of return, net
    present-value profitability index, debt coverage ratio, and gross income
    multiplier.  Compare these measurements with competing investments to
    help in making investment decisions personally or for clients.  NOTE:
    The comparison between competing potential investments is the important
    concept, not an exact prediction of future results for an individual
    investment.
    
    REIPS is designed around current Federal income tax law, although
    certain simplifying assumptions, such as those regarding the alternative
    minimum tax and passive losses, are made.  The manual provides
    information in terms that are easy to understand.
    
    The SIMPLE BOOKKEEPER is the easiest single entry bookkeeping system
    available for home or small businesses. No accounting experience is
    required. Keep track of business expenses (40 categories) and income
    for the year. Three report formats include yearly profit/loss summary
    and ytd expenses. Information is entered on a monthly basis.
    Registered users receive additional features including sorting, six
    income accounts, and six report formats.
    
    Turn your PC and its printer into an electric typewriter.  TYPERITE is
    simple, straight-forward and faster than using a wordprocessor for some
    day-to-day jobs.
