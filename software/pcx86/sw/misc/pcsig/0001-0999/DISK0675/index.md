## Information about "THE ENABLE READER 2 OF 4 (674,676,677)"

    The ENABLE READER PROFESSIONAL SPEECH SYSTEM was written to improve
    computer access for the blind and visually-impaired, and is actually two
    programs in one.
    
    The ``Full Screen Speech Review System'' is designed to let the
    visually-impaired use the wide selection of software written for
    MS-DOS compatibles.  Now programs like Lotus 1-2-3 or dBASE are
    available to everyone.
    
    The ``Talking Tutorial Programmer's Aid'' gives programmers access to
    many of the speech functions of the ENABLE READER to write talking
    tutorials for their software.
    
    Several synthesizer language versions are included for the most popular
    synthesizers available.  Among these are:
    
    ~ Artic Technologies - speech board.
    
    ~ Speech Plus - calltext 5050.
    
    ~ Digital Equipment Corp. - dectalk.
    
    ~ Street electronics - echo qp.
    
    ~ Votrax, Inc. - Votalker ib., Votrax pss., Votrax pss/b.
