## Information about "EASYRITE & LABELFILE"

    Two very basic and effective programs from GINACO.  EasyRite is a
    elementary text editor/word processor that is styled to make the
    computer perform like a typewriter.  With its onscreen documentation
    you can do most everything from the main menu.  The four modes of
    EasyRite are (1) LOAD and then review a file; (2) CREATE a file; (3)
    EDIT a file; and (4) PRINT a hard copy.  Several nice features that go
    beyond the simple stuff, for instance, a new or edited EasyRite file
    may be saved to any drive.
    
    LablFile is a self-documented, highly flexible file-management and
    label-print program which compliments EasyRite.  Both of the programs
    are provided in expanded ASCII, BASIC and compiled form; also, both
    can function on the PCjr.
    
    How to Start: Read the TEXT.ONE, README and FACTS files for information
    about the programs.  Both LablFile and EasyRite may be run from DOS by
    typing LF or ER <ENTER>.
