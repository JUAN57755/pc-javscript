## Information about "BASKETBALL SIMULATION"

    BASKETBALL is a text-based simulation of basketball -- not an
    interactive computer game.  Once you have chosen the teams and players,
    the game begins and you are a spectator.
    
    As play proceeds, the radio announcer's dialogue rolls across the
    screen.  If you enjoy listening to games on the radio, you will enjoy
    this game!  Rather than trying to capture the physical representation of
    basketball on the PC, this program effectively brings the thrill of the
    game to you the same way the radio sports announcer does.
    
    The program comes with data for six teams: the Celtics, the Lakers, the
    Rockets, the '76ers, and the East and West All-Star teams.  Play games
    with any combination of these teams or create teams of your own.
