## Information about "BATCH FILE UTILITIES"

    Batch files are tireless worker files. Once written and tested to insure
    that they are doing what you want them to do, they go on and on doing it
    with no slip-ups, complaints, or fatigue.
    
    The utilities on this disk are designed to as a batch file tutorial and
    also to enhance the batch file capabilities of your DOS operating
    system. Source code is included thoughout, making it possible to read or
    print out any of the files included. A lot of the material here would be
    pertinent to programmmers or advanced users who wanted to soup-up their
    systems with hard-working batch files.
