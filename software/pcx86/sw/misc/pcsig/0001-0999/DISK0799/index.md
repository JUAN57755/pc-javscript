## Information about "SIDEFILE"

    SIDEFILE is a memory-based database manager that works with relatively
    small to medium sized files.  These files can be subjected to extremely
    fast manipulation because all of the data is stored in memory,
    eliminating the constant slow down of accessing the disk for
    information.
    
    SIDEFILE is also a disk-based data manager that can operate on large
    numbers of records in a manner similar to larger programs.  In this
    filing mode, SIDEFILE retains its easy to use interface and
    spreadsheet-like screens while affording disk-based usage.
    
    SIDEFILE is a fast, easy, and very forgiving program that attempts to
    make life easier for all who regularly use small business or personal
    data files for nearly any purpose.  SIDEFILE lets you to manipulate
    your many notes, lists and files with a flexibility approaching,
    sometimes surpassing the talents of larger systems.  You can also keep
    some of your small spreadsheet-type applications in SIDEFILE instead of
    in an expensive spreadsheet program.  You can even do small editing
    jobs right within SIDEFILE instead of having to find and load yet
    another program such as a word processor or editor.  Of course, all of
    your SIDEFILE files will still be compatible with those other programs
    should you choose to use them.
    
    SIDEFILE uses two types of files: those with a built-in header line
    (data file), and those without a built-in header line (text file).  You
    can perform all available commands with a data file, but not with a
    text file.  Text file manipulation is mostly for convenience.
    
    SIDEFILE has proven to be one of the most flexible database programs
    available for the IBM PC.
    
    System Requirements:  None.
    
    How to Start: To start the SIDEFILE program, put your working disk in
    one of your disk drives and type SF (press enter).  You may type the
    name of the data file you wish SIDEFILE to load right on the command
    line -- SF DATAFILE (press enter).
