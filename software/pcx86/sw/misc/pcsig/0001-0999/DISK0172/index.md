## Information about "STEVE'S UTILITIES"

    This is a very nice collection of utilities that would make a
    worthwhile addition to almost anyone's system.  Included are routines
    to: let you change the beep tone of your PC to suit yourself, clear
    your display screen, several different programs to let you determine
    status of your machines ports, rework your keyboard arrangement, and
    much more.  The source code is included along with most of these
    programs.  Those of you so inclined may use this to make changes, or
    simply examine it to find out how other programmers do things.  This
    is an excellent way to enhance your machines capabilities, as well as
    your own.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require color, BASIC
    
    How to Start: To run an EXE or COM program simply type its name and
