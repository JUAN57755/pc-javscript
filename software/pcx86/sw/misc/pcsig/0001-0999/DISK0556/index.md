## Information about "FORTRAN AND ASSEMBLY"

    This is a mixed collection of games, usable programs, and utilities
    that can be called from FORTRAN programs.  Included is PLTSPEC which is
    useful in analyzing spectra with broad asymmetric peaks on a sloping
    background.  DIR_ASM.ASM is a routine which lists to the console the
    names of the files in the current directory.  There are also some .PIC
    files which are ASCII files to copy to a printer.  They contain
    drawings of various figures.
    
    System Requirements:  64K, one disk drive and monochrome display.
    
    How to Start:  To read DOC files, enter TYPE filename.ext and press
    <ENTER>.  To run an EXE program, just type its name and press <ENTER>.
    For instructions on ASM or FOR listings, refer to your Assembler or
    FORTRAN language manual.
