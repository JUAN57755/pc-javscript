## Information about "TEACHERS SPECIAL"

    This diskette contains a mix of educational programs designed to help
    both the teacher and the student.  The Register, "written by a teacher
    for teachers and tested in the classroom," is a grade database that
    will keep track of students' marks by course.  This is a fully featured
    demo version of the larger Register package.
