## Information about "PC-HAM"

    PC-HAM is a set of amateur radio database programs.  The program is
    based, in part, on programs described in, "Software for Amateur
    Radio," by Joe Kasser (G3ZCZ) and published by TAB Books.
    
    PC-HAM has several features that are invaluable to any amateur
    radio operator with a computer. Some of the program's capabilities
    include:
    
    ~ Display/print of your QSO's sorted by call-sign, alphanumerical order
    
    ~ Search for and display of all QSO's with a specified prefix
    
    ~ Automatic generation of your DXCC status
    
    ~ Direct updating of award records from the log entries
    
    ~ Analyze contest QSO's for duplicates and scoring contacts
    
    ~ Automatic QSL 100% (after a contest or DX-Pedition) to all stations
    worked for one contact on each of five bands.
