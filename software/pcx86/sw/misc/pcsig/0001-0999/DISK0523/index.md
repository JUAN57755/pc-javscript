## Information about "SIDE WRITER"

    Are your spreadsheets too wide to print in one piece?  Have you had to
    resort to cut-and-paste methods to tie your outline together?  Try
    SIDEWRITER.
    
    SIDEWRITER lets printers output sideways on paper.  This lets you print
    reports and other materials that do not fit across a page, because it
    prints down the length of the sheet instead of across the width.  It
    works much like SIDEWAYS.
    
    SIDEWRITER prints existing text sideways, allowing unlimited print
    width.  Spreadsheet columns can be printed on one continuous page.  The
    function keys and menus make it easy to learn and use.
