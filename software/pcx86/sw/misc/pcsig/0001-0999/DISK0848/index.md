## Information about "JUDY THE MEMORY RESIDENT CALENDAR"

    We've all wanted a personal secretary to keep track of our appointment
    schedule for us.  Let PC-SIG introduce you to the answer to your wish:
    JUDY CLONE, a memory-resident desktop organizer that keeps your
    schedules and appointments for years to come.
    
    JUDY maintains the full-screen interactive calendar.  She takes
    appointments, has editing functions, makes hard-copy, and goes through
    your notes and records, doing the daily filing tasks.  She fills your
    computer's memory, does her job, leaves and then returns her space to
    the memory pool.  She even wishes you ``Happy Birthday'' when that day
    rolls around.
