## Information about "ROFF"

    This version of ROFF, based on the formatter in Kernighan and
    Plauger's book SOFTWARE TOOLS, is written in BDS C, and employs
    the directed i/o functions that go along with that package.
    
    Using ROFF, you can make nice printouts of a file, with as little
    or as much help from the program as you want.  There are default
    values for all parameters, so if you don't put any commands in at
    all, your file will come out with filled, right-justified lines.
    The default line-length is 80 characters; the default page-length
    is 66 lines per page.  "Filled lines" means that as many input
    words as possible are packed onto a line before it is printed;
    "non-filled" lines go through the formatter w/o rearrangement.
    "Right-justified" simply means that spaces are added between
    words to make all the right margins line up nicely.
    
    Filling out the disk are a group of solid utilities like SDIR and
    REBOOT and some useful BASIC programs.
    
    How to Start:  Consult ROFF.DOC for directions and
    documentation. Type ROFF <ENTER> to run.  For the BASIC programs,
    consult the directions in Getting Started for your configuration.
