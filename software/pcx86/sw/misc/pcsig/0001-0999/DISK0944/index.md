## Information about "DOS CONTROLLER AND MR. MENU"

    A DOS shell for beginners and advanced computer users.
    
    DOS CONTROLLER can execute DOS commands and files from menus you
    create and acts as a shell to DOS. It helps beginning users become
    acquainted with the computer and helps advanced users shift between
    programs more easily.  DOS CONTROLLER lets you create your own program
    menu for your applications, and already has a menu of DOS commands for
    automatic execution.
    
    MR. MENU can help you easily create simple menus for quick access to
    programs, files, and DOS functions.
    
    You run programs by selecting a number from a menu or by highlighting a
    selection.  You can also execute batch files.  MR. MENU has multiple
    menus that let you easily move from menu to menu or return to the main
    menu.  A maintenance program constructs new menus or modifies existing
    ones.  You can either issue commands that are immediately executed or
    enter commands that require more input or parameters.
    
    MR. MENU is memory-resident and is automatically returned to after the
    program or command is done.  A configuration function lets you
    change the colors, default drive and directory, and opening screen
    titles.
