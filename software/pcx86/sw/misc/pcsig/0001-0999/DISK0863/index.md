## Information about "STATMATE/PLUS 3 OF 3 (ALSO 861, 862)"

    A statistical analysis package for handling numerical data, operated by
    entering one-line commands and subcommands.  Command ``batch'' files can
    be created for automatic execution, along with explanatory screen
    remarks.
    
    STATMATE operates on information contained in a database, generated by
    the program.  A user ID is required before entering a database, and for
    every new user ID, an empty database is created.  This feature permits
    multiple users to work with STATMATE while keeping the data files
    separated.
    
    Extract data from an ASCII text file and load it into the database for
    operation.  Data is stored in columns and rows, and you can extract
    portions of the data according to your specifications.  As you
    manipulate the data, the results can be displayed on the screen,
    printed, or saved on a disk file.
    
    The main analytic features are elementary statistics, scatter plots,
    cross tabulations, histograms, data comparison using the T-Test,
    correlation, arithmetic operations, distribution functions, curvilinear
    regression, multiple regression, nonlinear regression, data recoding,
    and data transformation and manipulation.  An on-line help facility is
    included to give you a detailed description of all the STATMATE
    commands.
