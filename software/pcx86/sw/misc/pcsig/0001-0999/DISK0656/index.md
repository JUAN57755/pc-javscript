## Information about "REAL ESTATE SYSTEM"

    RES is an asset for any professional real estate office.  It helps you
    maintain and organize information on properties for sale, as well as
    information on the agents in the company.
    
    Keep detailed records of sales and search for pending/closed sales at
    any time.  Keep agents's records of current/previous year
    commissions, add an agent, or search records of an agent.  Generate
    valuable reports on office/agent commissions, projected income,
    pending/closed sales, and unsold property listings.  An added feature is
    year-end processing which purges all closed sales from the system.
    
    Spend your time and energy on selling real estate and leave the tiresome
    bookkeeping to RES.
