## Information about "ESIE"

    Put some smarts in your personal computer and turn it into your very own
    assistant. ESIE, the Expert System Inference Engine, is an artificial
    intelligence shell that lets you build a custom knowledge base, or
    expert system, to help you make decisions.
    
    Simple but effective, ESIE operates by loading in a knowledge base and
    building inferences out of the rules contained therein. You define the
    rules that the system uses. This is especially good as an introduction
    to expert systems as well as having excellent on-disk documentation to
    get you started in AI. For the advanced student, ESIE can handle the
    normal gamut of expert systems building.
    
    To see how ESIE works without building your own knowledge base, load
    ESIE and one of the three supplied knowledge bases (ANIMAL, DOCTOR, or
    GLASS) and try it!
