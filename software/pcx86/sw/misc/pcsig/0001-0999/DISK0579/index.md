## Information about "PASCAL TUTOR 1 OF 2 (ALSO 580)"

    PASCAL TUTOR is a text-based tutorial on programming with the Pascal
    language.  The assumption is that you know nothing about Pascal in
    particular and programming in general.
    
    It begins with the most elementary aspects of programming and takes you
    through each step from dynamic allocation to the use of linked lists.
    The program was specifically written for use with Turbo Pascal versions
    3.0, 4.0, and 5.0.  Version 5.5 is also supported through two additional
    chapters covering object oriented programming.  The Pascal source code
    used for examples throughout the tutorial is included.
