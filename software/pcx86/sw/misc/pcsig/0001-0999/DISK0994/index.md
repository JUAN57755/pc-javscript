## Information about "FINANCIAL CALCULATOR"

    FINANCIAL CALCULATOR is a simple, menu-driven program that calculates
    interest on loans, savings, or payments.

    you will pay to the bank at the end of the loan.  Get a month-by-month
    breakdown of your monthly payments, interest for that month, payment on
    the principal and the ending balance for that month.  You can also
    figure the approximate annual interest rate for a loan.  A metric
    conversion utility is included.
