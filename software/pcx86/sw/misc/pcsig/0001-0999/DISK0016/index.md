## Information about "GAME SERIES NO 2"

    This early-days telecommunications program (the first shareware program
    ever) is as straightforward and unfancy (by today's standards) as they
    come. Nevertheless, it can keep phone number records, dial them for
    you, and generally perform the connection functions you need to tie
    your computer to another through a modem over phone lines. If your
    interests lean toward programming, all of the programs on this disk
    provide great examples of BASIC applications.  Something for beginning
    programmers to dig into!
    
    This disk covers a wide spectrum of entertainment. For the cerebral, we
    have a version of Chess. For the adventurous, we have a Star Trek
    simulation. And for the arcade player, we have Breakout. For the
    gamblers, we have included a version of the game Craps.
    
    How to Start:  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please refer
    to the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.
