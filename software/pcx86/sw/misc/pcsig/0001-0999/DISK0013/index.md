## Information about "PDRAW"

    This disk contains two sections.  STARTREK is a fine implementation of
    the game that has been around since time sharing has been popular on
    college campuses.  The game runs under BASIC and has sound effects.
    PDRAW is a simple line, circle, square, etc. drawing program.  It
    doesn't require a mouse, and has color fill for the enclosed areas of
    your drawing, not real powerful but a good starting program.  Last and
    least IBMSONG is something that everyone should see at least once.
    
    System Requirements: Some programs require color graphics; printer
    recommended.
    
    How to Start:  To run BASIC programs consult the directions in GETTING
    STARTED for your configuration.  Consult PDRAW.DOC for program
    documentation.
