## Information about "PCMAN   (PAC MAN GAME AND MORE)"

    This disk contains a splendid example of what can be done graphically
    without the need of a graphics card, either monochrome or color. PCMAN
    and PCGIRLA are two different versions of the age-old run-and-eat maze
    game that revolutionized the computer and arcade industries. PCGIRLA
    uses ASCII characters to draw out the maze, while PCMAN uses the same
    character but in a 40-column color mode, to represent the player and
    the monsters that live in the maze.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require color graphics.
    
    How to Start:  While PCCHEERS requires BASIC, all the other can be
    run from DOS by typing their filename and pressing <ENTER>.
