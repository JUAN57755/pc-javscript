## Information about "KEEP IN TOUCH"

    Keep in Touch is a networking tool for all kinds of people and
    organizations.  As networking is maintaining contact with people and
    organizations thereby sharing and distributing information, products,
    services, etc., tying them all together is key to success.  Keep in
    Touch may be that key for you!  Two other interesting observations
