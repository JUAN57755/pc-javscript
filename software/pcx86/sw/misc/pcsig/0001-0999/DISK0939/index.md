## Information about "FLIGHT PLANNING (ALSO 1476 )"

    FLIGHT is a flight-planning program for private pilots.
    
    Enter up to 20 waypoints by name and the estimated airspeed of the
    plane. The program matches the waypoints against data files, retrieves
    the latitude, longitude and magnetic variation for each point, and then
    calculates the magnetic course, the distance between the waypoints, and
    the estimated time between each set of waypoints.
    
    The results are printed on the screen, together with the total distance
    and the total estimated flight time. You can then have a flight log
    printed. The files containing the waypoints for FLIGHT can be edited
    from within the program or with an ASCII wordprocessor.
    
    MORSE is a workable code-practice program for anyone who wants to learn
    Morse Code for their Amateur Radio Operator's license.
    
    The program creates random-text groups of five characters each, then
    sends them in Morse code with the cursor underlining each word as it is
    sent.  MORSE also sends individual random letters well spaced in time
    and reads text files prepared by your wordprocessor in capitals, then
    sends the text line-by-line.
