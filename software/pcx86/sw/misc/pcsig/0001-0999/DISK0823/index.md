## Information about "INTERACTIVE MATRIX CALCULATOR"

    Data collection for statistical analysis is made easier with MATRIX
    CALCULATOR.  Twenty matrix areas, numbered from 1 to 20, can store 150
    elements each.  Since the matrices are in contiguous blocks, the
    capacities may be enlarged by, for instance, using every other matrix.
    This strategy results in 10 matrices with a capacity of 300 each.  One
    operation at a time is performed; i.e., only one multiplication, one
    addition, etc.  Results may be displayed at any time using the Print
    command.
    
    The idea of the INTERACTIVE REGRESSION program is that the researcher
    knows his data best.  Rather than provide canned variable selection
    routines, the researcher is prompted for the next step each time the
    model changes due to the addition or deletion of a variable.  At any
    particular step, variables that are in the equation may be deleted, or
    variables which are not in the equation may be added.  No provision is
    made for residual analysis since no data is stored.  This is a serious
    limitation of the program in terms of modern regression analysis
    procedures.
