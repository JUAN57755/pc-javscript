## Information about "CURVEFIT"

    Burnt out on Euclid?  Got the Newton blues?  If you're a weary
    mathematician or a bogged-down high-level math student, CURVEFIT is an
    excellent program for you.  CURVEFIT performs a least-squares curve fit
    on X, Y data.  Curves for 25 equations are fitted.  Equation
    coefficients, correlation coefficient, and best fit are computed with
    your data.  CURVEFIT can make predictions for Y in any of the 25
    equations.  Residuals are calculated.  The program does not include any
    graphics.
