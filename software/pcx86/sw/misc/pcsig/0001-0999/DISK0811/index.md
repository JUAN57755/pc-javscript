## Information about "INTELLI-TRIEVE"

    INTELLI-TRIEVE is a "weighted retrieval" utility for users of dBase
    III, dBase III+ and compatible database managers. Weighted retrieval
    is a way of sorting database records with greater flexibility than a
    simple sort. The weighted retrieval sorts on multiple fields, but it
    allows you to put numeric "importance" on different fields and then
    totals your database's "score" over several different fields.
    
    INTELLI-TRIEVE performs weighted retrieval by comparing each record in
    a database to user-defined selection criteria and produces a copy of
    the database with the records arranged in descending order of
    acceptability. The result is an entirely new view of your data, one
    that cannot be attained through standard indexing, filtering or
    sorting operations.
    
    A simple, menu-driven process helps you choose a database and the
    fields that are to be included in the weighted retrieval calculations.
    Decide how each field is to be judged and weighted, without reworking
    your database or program. The function is nondestructive and leaves
    the original files intact. New files are created with the data
    rearranged according to the sort criteria.
