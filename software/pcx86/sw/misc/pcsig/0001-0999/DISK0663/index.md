## Information about "DATA BOSS 2 OF 2 (662 1ST DISK IN SET)"

    This is the first of a two-disk set comprising the DATABOSS Data
    Management System. DATABOSS is a database with flexible report-
    generation and the ability to import and export data to Wordstar, PC-
    File III, DW III and many other programs. It sports user-defined color
    screens, up to eight different disk drives or subdirectories, pre-
    computed (equivalence) fields, wide standard reports, user-defined
    printer characteristics, a full alphabet keyboard enhancer, simple
    mathematical and statistical functions, sorting for up to eight levels,
    and enhanced search capabilities.  This first disk holds the
    documentation for version 3.00.01 of the DATABOSS system -- 70+ pages
    of how-to information with some special tips on maximizing the use of
    your hard disk(s). NOTE: DATABOSS runs in BASIC and needs MS/PC DOS
    3.xx and a hard disk for full functioning.
    
    System Requirements: 128K memory and at least one disk drive.  Two
    drives or a hard drive is recommended.
    
    How to Start: For information on starting the program and printing the
    documentation, type: GO (press enter).
