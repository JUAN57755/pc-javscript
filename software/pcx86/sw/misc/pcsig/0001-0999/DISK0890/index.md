## Information about "THE BRIDGE GAME"

    TURBO-BRIDGE is a bridge game that lets you practice playing against
    yourself or the computer.  Not only can this program be used for fun,
    but it can help you practice the strategies of the game.
    
    You can have all four hands in play displayed on the table, allowing you
    to play the hands of as many of the players as you wish or, after
    bidding, the computer can play out the game.  You may or may not want
    the computer to see your hand.  Not only are the cards in your hand (and
    optionally others) displayed, but the played cards are listed.
