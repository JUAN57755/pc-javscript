## Information about "WORLD STATISTICS"

    WORLD is a simple, menu-driven database of statistical and demographic
    information about the nations.  The information was extracted from
    "The Encyclopedia Britanica Year Book for 1986" and "Countries of the
    World and Their Leaders Yearbook 1986."

    capitals, geography, population, per capita income, sovereignity of
    more than 100 countries.  Probably the most interesting menu is the

    mortality and life expectancy rates for male and female citizens.
