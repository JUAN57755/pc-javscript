## Information about "TURBO CALC"

    popular spreadsheet program. Function keys are utilized, and operation
    is by use of complete on-screen menus. AsEasyAs creates x-y
    graphs and bar charts as well.

    How to Start:  Consult all documentation files before starting either
    program (they are marked with filename.DOC).  While the TurboCalc

    archive the AsEasyAs program.  Once done, either may be started from
    the DOS prompt.
