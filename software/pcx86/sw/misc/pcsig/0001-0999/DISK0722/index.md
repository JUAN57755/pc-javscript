## Information about "COMPOSER"

    OK, Schroeder -- I mean Beethoven -- here's a program for you.
    COMPOSER
    is a simple music editor that lets you create music and then integrate
    your creation into a batch file or a program written in Turbo Pascal. A
    visual display of a piano keyboard lets you play and "record" your
    music from the computer keys.  COMPOSER is a great way to bring musical
    life to programs you have written.  It has a three-octave range and
    requires some knowledge of music terminology to create original music.
    Eleven prewritten songs come with the program.
    
    Though it lets Turbo Pascal access the songs, it does not put the files
    into source code.  By calling the file TRBOTUNE.SYS in your Pascal
    program, you can access your songs.
