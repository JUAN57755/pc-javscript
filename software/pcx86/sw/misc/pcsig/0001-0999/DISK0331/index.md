## Information about "MEDLIN ACCOUNTING"

    MEDLIN ACCOUNTING is a group of four companion accounting packages
    which, when used together, provide fast easy-to-use accounting services
    for the small to medium sized business.
    
    The first and main program, PC-GL, is a double-entry General Ledger
    module which allows up to 800 items in the chart of accounts and 6,000
    transactions per period. It can be used by itself or with PC-AP -- the
    Accounts Payable package. PC-AP is an Accounts Payable program that
    allows a maximum of 2000 vendors and 2000 invoices per month. PC-AR is
    a menu-driven Accounts Receivable module and supports up to 2000
    customers and 4000 invoices per month. PC-PR, the payroll program,
    includes both current federal tax tables, support for most state taxes,
    and a W2 program. All programs use the same commands, and share the
    same operating features.
    
    NOTE: All programs are run in RAM which accounts for their speed but
    also controls how many files can be supported at a time. Numbers of
    supported accounts quoted above are based on at least 512K RAM. Less
    RAM will allow the modules to run but will support a smaller number of
    accounts.
