## Information about "AM-TAX 1990"

    AM-TAX helps you prepare your federal tax return.  It does most
    calculations for you and, where possible, checks if the information you
    entered is consistent and valid.
    
    Because it's powerful, you can try ``what if'' situations.  Change an
    income or deduction and instantly see the result on your tax balance or
    refund.  Many commonly-used forms and schedules are supported, as well
    as worksheets for specific situations such as capital gains, partnership
    and corporate income, and estate or trust income.  Information entered
    or calculated for a supporting form is automatically transferred to the
    appropriate line it supports.  All the forms can be printed and
    filed directly with the IRS.
