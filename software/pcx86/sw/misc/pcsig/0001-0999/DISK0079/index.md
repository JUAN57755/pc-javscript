## Information about "DOS UTILITIES NO 2"

    This disk contains an assortment of utilities, and a game or two, to
    interest almost anyone.  The selection includes the popular game of
    LIFE in several versions; programs to test your drives, change your
    keyboard, and control your printer.  Other games and utilities should
    give something for almost anyone.
    
    KEYLOK is one of those convenience utility keys that you'll either find
    functional because of the way you work on a computer or not. When the
    program is loaded, it automatically holds down the ALT, CTRL, and SHFT
    keys with your first stroke and releases them on your second stroke,
    creating a toggle effect. It causes those keys to function much as the
    CAPSLOCK key does.  This saves a lot of the hassles and the awkwardness
    of holding them down as you operate the main keyboard with one hand.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require BASIC.
    
    How to Start: To run a COM or EXE program simply type its name and
    press <ENTER>.  For instructions on ASM listings, refer to your
    Assembler manual.  To read DOC or TXT files, simply enter TYPE
    filename.ext and press <ENTER>.
