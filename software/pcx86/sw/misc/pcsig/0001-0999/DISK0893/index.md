## Information about "PRIVATE LINE AND WEAK LINK"

    Information is the currency of today's world.  Protect your data with
    THE PRIVATE LINE, an encryption/decryption program.
    
    When encrypting or decrypting a file, THE PRIVATE LINE prompts you
    before overwriting an existing file.  Single and double encryption is
    provided, the latter involving the encryption of an encrypted file,
    preferably with a different key.
    
    An encrypted file usually contains binary data, but some bulletin
    boards, such as CompuServe and EasyLink, require ASCII text files. THE
    PRIVATE LINE can convert a file from binary format to printable ASCII
    and then print it.  Included is an option which demonstrates compliance
    with the 171 tests required to meet the Data Encryption Standard of the
    NBS.
    
    Use WEAKLINK to transfer files between your PCs via RS232 serial
    ports.
    
    Its primary use is to allow file transfers between two machines that
    have different or non-removable media.  For example, file transfers can
    be made from the 3.5" floppy drive of one machine to the 5.25" drive of
    another.  When installed and activated, the master unit can access and
    transfer files to or from any or all of the drives of the slave unit
    incuding RAM disks.  Transfer speed of data is selectable from 1200 to
    115K baud.
