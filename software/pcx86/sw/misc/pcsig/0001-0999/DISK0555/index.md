## Information about "LINPACK DRIVERS"

    The Linear Equation Package (LINPACK) is a set of routines which solves
    systems of linear equations and related problems.  This package was
    developed by the Applied Mathematics Division of Argonne National
    Laboratory; this source code was taken from a distribution disk
    provided by International Mathematics and Statistical Libraries,
    Inc. (IMSL).
    
    System Requirements:  Fortran complier, 256K memory, color display,
    graphics card and printer and one drive unit.
    
    How to Start:  Consult README and INDEX for program information.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $10.00
