## Information about "SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL"

    SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL is a complete word processing program
    specifically designed for the creation of screenplays and teleplays.
    Special care has been taken to keep SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL simple to
    use, so you can concentrate on your writing instead of on a stack of
    computer manuals.  SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL is the first complete word
    processor for film and television writers. It includes both a complete
    text editor and formatter, so no other software is needed. If you have
    ever tried to use a regular word processing program to generate this
    very complex format, you'll really appreciate this one.
    
    Other programs on this disk include TURBO SCRIPT, a word processor
    designed specifically for the 128K PCjr, along with a host of assorted
    text-processing utilities that can count words, help create indexes,
    and convert Displaywrite files to ASCII text format.
    
    Special Requirements: None.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration: $10.00 for every piece you get published using
    ScreenWright!
