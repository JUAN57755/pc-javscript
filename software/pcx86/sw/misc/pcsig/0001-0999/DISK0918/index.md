## Information about "CAMBRIDGE THOROUGHBRED HANDICAPPER"

    CAMBRIDGE THOROUGHBRED HANDICAPPER attempts to predict a horse or dog's
    race performance by analyzing past performances in a consistent,
    scientific manner.  It also gives you a strategy for betting on races
    based on your handicapping analysis.
    
    The system blends sophistication and ease-of-use for the race fan who
    enjoys the sport but doesn't have hours to devote to handicapping.  If
    you've never handicapped a race before, you'll find this informative.
    If you're an experienced handicapper, the data you collect is just as
    useful as the ratings themselves.  Sharpen your own analytical thinking.
