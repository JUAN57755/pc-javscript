## Information about "ICON MAKER & FXMATRIX"

    ICON MAKER is a menu-driven program that allows you to create graphical
    icons and cross-stitch graphics interactively in any of three graphical
    modes supported by the IBM PC family.  These three modes include the
    high resolution 640 X 200 two color, the 320 X 200 four color, and the
    160 X 100 sixteen color.  The icons you create can then be used
    directly in your program data area instead of having to be accessed as
    an outside file by your program.
    
    All icons created can be saved in an ASCII file which will than be used
    in a form that is acceptable by the macro assembler (in the form of dw
    and db statements) and can be used in the data segment of your program
    to define your shape.
    
    Are you sick and tired of printing the same old characters over and
    over again on your Epson FX or JX printer?  Or maybe you've decided to
    come up with your own alphabet.  Well, FXMATRIX can add some spice to
    your printouts.
    
    FXMATRIX is a matrix program that permits you to design user-created
    characters, store them in a file, and download them to the Epson FX and
    JX dot matrix printers.  These created characters can then be used from
    any word processor, even if your word processor resets the
    printer upon execution.
