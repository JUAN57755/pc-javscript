## Information about "ROCKET SIMULATION"

    LAUNCHER simulates a single stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. This is a
    very good quality simulation to learn the "feel" for orbital
    mechanics. You can design your own vehicle and pilot it to orbit and
    rendezvous with the space station. An interest in orbital mechanics is
    required (knowledge about it would be helpful, but is not mandatory). A
    documentation file is included.
    
    A collection of programs inspired by the Computer Recreations column in
    "Scientific American." Several data files are included.
    
    ~ HYPER -- a hyper cube (fourth-dimensional cube) drawing program.
    
    ~ WALLPAP -- an intricate patterns drawing program with a very simple
    numeric seed.
    
    ~ WATOR -- a biosphere simulation in which fish are eaten by sharks,
    which die and reproduce.
    
    ~ CLUSTER -- a simulation of the motion of star clusters of two or more
    stars.
