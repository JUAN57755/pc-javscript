## Information about "XLISP"

    XLISP is an experimental programming language combining some features of
    LISP with an object-oriented extension capability. It is written in C
    and is easily extended with user-written functions and classes. It
    assumes some knowledge of LISP and object-oriented programming. This
    version has both MS-DOS and PC-DOS specific code.
    
    This package represents an inexpensive opportunity to begin to tackle
    programming in the field of artificial intelligence.
