## Information about "DANCAD 3D 1 OF 4 (ALSO 702,703,704)"

    DANCAD3D is an excellent and versatile drawing program that lets you do
    very complex things like stereoscopic 3D wire-frame drawing, or very
    simple things like designing letterheads. Draw in two and three
    dimensions. Separate groups of lines into "elements" that can be
    saved, loaded, magnified, rotated, flipped, offset (moved), and used
    over and over again. Keep them as a file on a disk (give them names
    like cube, sphere, and cylinder).
    
    DANCAD3D prints surprisingly sharp, crisp lines on Epson/IBM-compatible
    dot-matrix printers. Use it for many different
    applications, including the following:
    
    ~ Mechanical drawings and technical illustrations
    
    ~ Business forms of many kinds
    
    ~ Page layouts which combine text and drawings
    
    ~ Automatic computer slide shows
    
    ~ Engineering simulation to verify the fit of three-dimensional shapes
    
    DANCAD3D also supports many plotters, PostScript laser printers, and
    image setters such as the Linotronic 300. It works with a mouse, 3-D
    track ball, or cursor keys.
    
    DANCAD3D includes the DANMOVIE program, a full demonstration, and its
    documentation. DANMOVIE is a very useful engineering tool. With it,
    you can program DANCAD3D to make an animated close-up of parts in a
    layout drawing. Use this close-up to confirm the fit of moving parts.
    Produce an animated perspective view of the entire assembly with all of
    the parts in motion.
