## Information about "CROSSREF"

    Here's an excellent Shareware BASIC programming tool that provides a
    cross-referenced listing of variables referenced in the construction of
    a BASIC program. Listing shows what and where the variable has been
    used in the source code.
    
    The cross-referenced package is put into text file format which the
    programmer can either punch up on the screen or print out for future
    reference. Crossref is one of those "glad-to-have" tools that save the
    programmer from re-inventing the wheel with each project.
    
    How to Start: Read and then print the file CROSSREF.DOC.  The
    directions to run the programs are on that file.
