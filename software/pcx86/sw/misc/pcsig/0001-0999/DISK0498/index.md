## Information about "DOS-A-MATIC"

    DOSAMATIC is a task-switching utility that lets you load several
    programs and transfer between them with simple keystroke commands.
    
    It has a menu that lists available drives, directories, and files on
    the current drive.  Commands available include VIEW, SORT, RENAME, EDIT,
    PRINT, DEBUG, COPY, and DELETE.  Programs can be run from memory.  Now
    you can do two things at once.
