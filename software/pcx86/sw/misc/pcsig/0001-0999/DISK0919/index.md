    four-function calculator; and an appointment calendar that can arrange
    and print appointment schedules for up to 12 months.  Included in
    POTPOURRI is a routine to describe system hardware configuration, a
    drawing program for sketching and a music program to create and playback
    music files.  All the programs described have documentation screens
    accessible from the main menu.
