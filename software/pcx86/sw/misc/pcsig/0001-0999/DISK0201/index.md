## Information about "WORDSTART & FINANCIAL"

    This early collection of WordStar utilities is headlined by Version 2.1
    of UNDOWS, considered an answer to prayer by many word processors.  If
    you need to change WordStar files to ASCII in a hurry or want to remove
    those soft hyphens or embedded control characters that WordStar leaves
    in a file, UNDOWS does all that for you.  And more: two new options
    allow you to strip extra carriage return / line feed pairs and to
    remove embedded dot commands from your text.
    
    Other WordStar Helps: FIXWS converts Wordstar files to ASCII and UNDOWS
    which converts Wordstar to standard ASCII as well as WS-DOC.BAS, a
    BASIC program for doing both!  It also has some special word
    processors: FORMGEN.BAS, a BASIC and simple word processor and POW.COM,
    an equally small but effective word processor.
    
    The financial programs include: 78INT.BAS is a handy utility and BASIC
    program for calculating the Rule of 78's (interest/principle) and
    DISBURSE.BAS which handles disbursements register, single entry, with
    annual summaries.
    
    System Requirements:  BASIC
    
    How to Start:  For the BASIC programs, consult the Getting
    Started section for your configuration.  The rest run from DOS by
    entering the filename and pressing <ENTER>.
