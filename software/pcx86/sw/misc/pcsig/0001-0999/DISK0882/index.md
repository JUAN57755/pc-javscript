## Information about "THE POOL MANAGER"

    It's a great day, sports fans!  Here's something you've needed for
    years.
    
    THE POOL MANAGER makes running a football pool a snap.  Whether the
    featured event at a private party or the regular office pool, FPM does
    all the tedious work.  Enter the basic information and it handles
    everything else, from generating a picksheet to printing the final
    standings.
    
    It has complete flexibility to handle up to 18 games and 90
    participants in a single pool.  For NFL pools, the teams are already
    stored in the program, just indicate the opponents.  You can maintain
    season-long standings, utilize a tiebreaker, and determine winning teams
    by applying the point spread.  It can be used for pools in any sport.
    
    So, who do you like for next week?
