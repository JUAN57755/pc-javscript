## Information about "FINGER PAINTING PROGRAM"

    FINGER PAINT, reminiscent of some programs for the Macintosh, is an
    easy-to-use, straightforward paint program for either home or office
    use.
    
    FINGER PAINT has most of the bells and whistles you would find in a
    print program, such as variable drawing functions (dots, lines,
    rectangles, circle, arcs, etc.).  But it also has a few that are rare
    in a program of this price -- animation, variable text fonts, 3-D
    drawing, and more.  The Movie command can serve as a slide show or
    animation program.  19 demo pictures are included to demonstrate this
    feature.  One of its major advantages is its Hercules graphics
    compatibility.  This means it can run on many computers.  The picture
    file format is PCX which can be used by almost all paint programs.  The
    non-registered copy of FINGER PAINT works only with the HP LaserJet
    printer and produces a 150 dot-per-inch output.
