## Information about "T-REF"

    If your programming language of choice is Turbo Pascal, you'll find that
    you won't be able to resist this one.
    
    T-REF is a lister/cross-referencing program that makes your programming
    easier and quicker.  Features include a full-screen driver with switch-
    selectable options; context-sensitive help windows to speed the learning
    process; and output directable to file or printer.  You can also reform
    words in the lister along with line numbers, lexical and block-level
    numbering; cross-reference selection by object type and usage; error
    analysis; procedural table of contents; and much, much more.
