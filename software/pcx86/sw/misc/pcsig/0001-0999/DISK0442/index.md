## Information about "SPA:WN"

    Learn the concepts of nodal or structured programming with SPA:WN,
    Structured Programming Automated: Warnier Notation.
    
    Tutorials are provided on the concepts of structured programming, and a
    program for use during design, documentation, and long-term
    maintenance of structured programs in any high-level language.
    
    Warnier notation provides a graphic description of relationships between
    various components.  SPA:WN provides the framework that lets you track
    these relationships.  It then produces target language source code,
    again in any high-level language, as well as automatic layout and
    pagination of a Warnier diagram.  The SPA:WN  system provides the
    technical support which enables life cycle program/system management to
    be done entirely from Warnier diagrams.
    
    The concepts of structured programming are also applicable to computer
    or other complex system design.
