## Information about "POKER & ULTIMA21"

    Play draw poker head-to-head with the computer.  POKER has
    a sophisticated style of playing and betting, and is intended to
    challenge the serious poker player.
    
    It's honest.  The computer does not know what is in your hand
    unless there is a showdown.
    
    It's smart.  The game has different patterns of betting and can observe
    your style of betting and modify its own behavior accordingly.
    
    It's cagey.  POKER can bluff in several ways and sometimes makes large
    bets with bad hands or no bets with good hands.  Every action it takes
    has at least two possible interpretations.  The randomness of the
    shuffling has been tested in simulations involving over half a million
    hands and the results mirror those expected in normal poker playing.
    
    Ante up and deal 'em.
    
    Play Blackjack as it's played in the casinos with the computer as the
    dealer.  ULTIMA21 keeps track of the hands played and who won each hand.
    It also shows your longest winning (and losing) streaks.  In addition,
    you can set up your own options -- resplit aces, double-down on any
    number of cards, make the dealer stand on 17, turn the sound on during
    play, and other things to keep it interesting.
