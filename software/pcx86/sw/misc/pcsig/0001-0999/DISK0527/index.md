## Information about "BASIC WINDOWING TOOLBOX FOR PROGRAMERS"

    BASIC WINDOWING TOOLBOX (B-WINDOW) is a collection of functions that
    give windowing capability to a BASIC programmer.  Windows can be opened
    over sections of the screen and, when closed, the overwritten section
    of the screen is restored.  With B-WINDOW, BASIC programs look more
    visually exciting and professional.  B-WINDOW works with both QuickBASIC
    and interpreted BASIC.  Special windowing cursor control and string
    character display, and border drawing are included.  Everything happens
    at top speed because B-WINDOW was written in C, converted to assembler,
    and hand-optimized.
