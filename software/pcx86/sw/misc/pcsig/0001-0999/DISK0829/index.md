## Information about "NEW YORK EDIT (PROGRAMMERS EDITOR)"

    NEW YORK EDIT is a program editor, written by the author of NEW YORK
    WORD, containing a C-like macro programming language which can be used
    to extend the editor.
    
    Sample macros are included and you can create other macros to define
    your own commands.  Other features of interest to programmers are:
    multiple windows, column cut-and-paste, capturing DOS output, line
    marking, regular expression search and substitute, EGA support
    (forty-three-line display), and a keyboard remapper.
    
    Up to 12 windows can be displayed simultaneously, with a different
    file in each window.  You can enlarge any window to occupy the whole
    screen.  Place bookmarks at various points in the document, and return
    to any point at any time.  Scroll continuously up or down the document,
    with user-selectable scrolling speed.  There are 10 buffers which you
    can use to temporarily store text.  A configuration file is included to
    change the program parameters.
