## Information about "MIX IT UP MISC. GAMES"

    If you're in a gaming mood, here are four great entertainment programs
    in our library.
    
    NEVADA POKER MACHINE is a simple-to-play, one-player poker game in which
    you may discard one to five unwanted cards of those dealt to you.  The
    payoff odds are shown at the top right corner of the screen, and the
    winnings are shown at the bottom.  If you've ever played a poker machine
    in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, NEVADA POKER MACHINE will be very
    familiar to you.
    
    If poker is not your cup of tea, PRO LOTTO is designed to help you win
    lotteries ranging from a 6/15 through a 6/52 format.  PRO LOTTO lets you
    store all the past numbers you have played and all past winning numbers.
    When choosing a lottery number you can put in your own number or a
    number produced by random generation.  With PRO LOTTO your computer can
    also generate a number based upon the past record of winning lottery
    numbers.
    
    PRO LOTTO can also produce a graphic screen showing what numbers are
    chosen most often, and can find the twelve most popular numbers for both
    you and your state's numbers.  The program will print out the numbers
    you have chosen and the winning numbers from previous games.  PRO LOTTO
    can show the money you have spent on the lottery and the odds of
    winning, and can look for all the matches you have made with the lottery
    for both matching and non-matching dates.
    
    For those more analytical in their entertainment pleasures, and for
    those for whom a text-adventure is more to their liking, MUTANT INVASION
    is for you.  This game puts you inside a science-fiction adventure in
    the year 2000.  You're within a dome that covers the city to protect it
    from the firesky at nighttime.  You can no longer hear the screams of
    the Outsiders, but you know they are very near.  The atmospheric
    radiation storms are slowly quieting.  Although most of the oceanic
    disturbances have run their course, tidal waves, typhoons and minor
    hurricanes occasionally come to claim a few more lives.
    
    You are one of the survivors from the last war.  But no one really knows
    what happened since all the radios, televisions and telephones went
    silent when the sky began to burn.  The Outsiders, as you can guess, are
    not human.  Most people call them mutants.  They have more or less
    become used to living outside the city dome, out in the Burn.  But
    there's no food or water fit for consumption, even for them.  That's why
    they're coming again now.  A few of the mutants have found a way into
    the dome.  Do you feel ready to stop them?  You must find their secret
    entrance and seal it off.
    
    If you're more of a mystery fan than a sci-fi fan, the second adventure
    game is for you.  INTERCEPT starts with you on the street in front of a
    car and a phone booth.  If you look closely at your possessions, you see
    you have an ID card (not for buying alcohol) and a watch.  Now, if you
    type in the correct command, you can get into the car.  Once you're
    inside the car, what do you do?  Get out, go into the phone booth, call
    your friend to find out how to start the car?  You'll have to discover
    what to do on your own.
