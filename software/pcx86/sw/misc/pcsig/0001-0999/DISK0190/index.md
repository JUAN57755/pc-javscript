## Information about "TEXT AND SCREEN"

    Most of the programs on this disk are in BASIC and must be run under
    the Interpretive BASIC provided on PC's and most clones.  The central
    program on the disc is FULLSCREEN which is a fullscreen editor for use
    with BASIC instead of the cranky line editor provided with PC BASIC.
    It is simple to use, driven by the function key menu at the bottom of
    the screen just as in standard BASIC.  The function key menu has
    several levels which provide most all the functions offered by most
    text editors.  The other programs provide a variety of functions, such
    as form building, memo building, string search, file converions,
    directory changes and the like.
    
    System Requirements: BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the RV-EDIT.DOC and INFO.DOC (FULLSCREEN) files
    for instructions; the others have onscreen help.  To run a BASIC
    program, type BASICA <filename> and hit <ENTER>.  Please note that you
    must either put a copy of BASICA on this disk, or have BASICA on your
    current DOS path.  To run programs suffixed .EXE, just type its name,
    i.e., for X.EXE, type X and hit <ENTER>.
