## Information about "PROINDEX - A DATABASE"

    Writers, Students, Editors -- PROINDEX lets you negotiate the most
    problem-filled part of writing a document or book: building the index.
    
    PROINDEX saves you the trouble of having to handmark each and every word
    you want in your index.  You simply provide a file of words listing the
    keywords you want to be in your index, and PROINDEX searches your
    document and marks all occurrences of those keywords.  Works with any
    ASCII text file (as well as WordStar files).
    File Descriptions:
    
    PROTEST  KEY  Example keyword file.
    PROTEST  TXT  Example document file.
    PROINDEX DOC  On disk documentation.
    PROINDEX EXE  Main program.
    ADMINESE TXT  Sample text file.
    REVADMIN TXT  Sample text file.
    AUTOEXEC BAT  Start-up batch file.
    STUDNESE TXT  Sample text file.
    STPAUL   TXT  Sample text file.
