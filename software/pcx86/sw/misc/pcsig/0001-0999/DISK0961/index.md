## Information about "MINI-MINDER AND INVENTORY SORT"

    Keep track of your inventory and other applicable information  you need
    to analyze your inventory position.
    
    INVENTORY SORT can handle multiple inventory lists which can have up to
    1,000 part types in each. Maintain five fields of information per part
    type -- including part number, part name, quantity, location, and cost.
    Sort records alphabetically, numerically, or by location. Update and
    delete part types, and get a formatted printout of the inventory list.
    Wholesale and retail cost values can be tracked as well.
    
    MINI MINDER is an easy-to-use rental property management system written
    specifically for managers of mini-warehouses or locker rental areas.
    (With a little imagination, the program could be adapted to fit almost
    any rental property situation.)
    
    Track information such as size (or other description), rental rate,
    various tenant data, payment records, and expense of operation on a
    property.  Perform other tasks, such as producing mailing labels in
    record sequence and billing tenants.  Run daily reports, list all
    outstanding units (those who have not paid yet), view the status on a
    single unit, or list the status of all units.
