## Information about "TEST AND TRAIN"

    Whether you're a teacher wanting to give tests on the computer, or a
    student who needs to drill for tests or courses, or a manager who needs
    to administer training drills to your employees, TEST and TRAIN can
    help you do the job.
    
    You enter the questions and TEST AND TRAIN displays them on the screen.
    The program offers slightly different scoring options for testing and
    training.  In both cases, the program accepts valid answers and rejects
    inappropriate ones, showing the correct answer with an optional comment
    when the answer is incorrect.  You can put incorrectly answered
    questions on hold, and view them again until the correct answer is
    given.  TEST keeps score of points associated with correct answers, and
    counts the number of incorrect answers entered.  At the end of the test
    the program displays an optional evaluation, and stores the results in a
    permanent file on your disk.
