## Information about "WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE AND SOLITAIRE"

    We've all said ``I can do that'' when it comes to guessing the letters
    on that game show.  Here's your chance to prove it, but there are a
    couple of twists added to the situation.
    
    TOMMY'S WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE is a one- to six player game in which
    players compete to guess a puzzle consisting of a word or phrase.  The
    wheel has 24 slots, each with a money value or a special slot.  Landing
    on a special slot can cause bankruptcy, give you a free spin, or make
    you lose a turn.  Landing on the other slots earns you money if you
    guess a consonant of the puzzle correctly; if you guess a wrong letter
    that amount is subtracted from your winnings, thus giving you an
    incentive to be correct every time!  The standard rules are available as
    an option.
    
    The player who wins the first three rounds of the game goes on to the
    bonus round with a chance for the BIG money.  There are more than 1,200
    phrases packed into this fast paced and addictive program which features
    pop-up instructions, mute switch, and a moving Vanna.
    
    SOLITAIRE is a computer version of the classic card game with
    additional features.  Undo your last card played, select the number of
    cards to turn from the deck each time (usually three), and ask the
    computer whether or not there are any additional plays that can be made
    in a certain turn.  There are several cheating options that you may or
    may not want to use, such as peeking at the first overturned card in
    each stack.  On-line help is available to the player throughout the
    game.
