## Information about "BUSINESS AND MORAL VALUE (ALSO 1018)"

    BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BUSINESS ETHICS AND MORAL VALUES has a list of
    periodical references, texts, books, syllabi collections, and
    audiovisual materials compiled by Dr. Kenneth Bond of Humboldt State
    University. This is the fourth edition and it is updated about every
    year and a half.
    
    Some subjects included are: energy, environmental issues (strip mining,
    toxic chemicals and water pollution), worker issues (discrimination,
    sexual harassment, whistle blowing, etc.), privacy, distribution of
    wealth, third world issues and more.  An incredible resource!
