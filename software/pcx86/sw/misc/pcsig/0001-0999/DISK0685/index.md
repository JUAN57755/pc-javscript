## Information about "NEW FIG FORTH"

    For fans of FORTH, here is the latest version of this unusual
    programming language.  This version of FIG-FORTH incorporates a number
    of significant changes to the FIG version.  The Following is a partial
    list:
    
    ~  Written for Microsoft's MACRO-86 assembler

    ~  All I/O is vectored and may be re-directed within FORTH
    ~  Command line interpretation
    
    The accompanying documentation includes a user's guide, a technical
    reference manual, and a FORTH glossary (a list and explanation of each
    FORTH word which has been changed or added to this version).
    
    Special Requirements:  2 disk drives and a printer is optional.
