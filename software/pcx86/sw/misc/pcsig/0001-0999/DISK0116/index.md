## Information about "MICROGOURMET 1 OF 2  (#117 SECOND DISK)"

    MicroGourmet is a two-disk software package, which functions through
    dBASE II, but will also run through dBASE III after it is converted. It
    was designed to help those of you who spend great gobs of time looking
    through cookbooks and rummaging through scraps of paper to find those
    elusive recipes you put right here or maybe here...or!!!
    
    MicroGourmet will help reduce the time spent choosing recipes to
    prepare for both family and guest meals.  It is also an aid to menu
    planning.  You can select recipes for whatever time period you wish (a
    week, for instance), print the recipes (as a reference), and prepare
    and print a shopping list to take to the store.  You can also add and
    change recipes. A great way to increase your culinary skills.
