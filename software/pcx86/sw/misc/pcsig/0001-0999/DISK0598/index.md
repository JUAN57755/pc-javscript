## Information about "PROFESSIONAL MASTER KEY"

    MASTER KEY is a powerful disk and file manipulation utility, comparable
    to programs like Norton Utilities.
    
    Edit any part of any disk or file using a handy windowed hex and ASCII
    screen dump. Editing can be from the ASCII text or the hex dump. Menus
    and organization help you learn the package quickly. Many other
    utilities are included, such as duplicate file search, file renaming
    and erasing abilities, and unerasing of files mistakenly erased.
