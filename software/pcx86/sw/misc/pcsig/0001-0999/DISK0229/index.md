## Information about "FUNNELS AND BUCKETS"

    FUNNELS teaches math as a game, attracting young ones to the subject. A
    very effective tool since they'll be too busy having fun to notice they
    are learning!
    
    Arithmetic problems fall from the sky and the idea is to solve them
    before they hit the bucket on the ground. A tap on the space bar while
    the problem is falling brings the solution. The "falling" speed can
    be adjusted for age. When the buckets are full, the game is over.
    Target ages: 5-11.
