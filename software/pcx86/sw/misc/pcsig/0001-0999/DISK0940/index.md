## Information about "POINT & SHOOT HOME MANAGER"

    HOME MANAGER helps you manage the details of operating a home and its
    (sometimes complicated) day-to-day finances.
    
    Create a database of your assets and liabilities, budget and track your
    home finances, print addresses on envelopes (laser printers only) or
    labels, calculate various payments and interest earnings, schedule and
    track maintenance on your home, create a list of things to do, track
    your vehicle maintenance and make lists of general items, names,
    addresses and phone numbers, and your important data.  Print any or all
    of these records.  There is also a built-in calculator and calendar to
    view each month of any year.  Also includes a complete double-entry
    accounting system that is easy enough for beginners yet sophisticated
    enough for small businesses.
