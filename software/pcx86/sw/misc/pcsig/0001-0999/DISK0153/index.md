## Information about "HANGMAN"

    HANGMAN is a game that enhances spelling and vocabulary. The program
    picks problems for you to solve from a diversified collection of data
    files.  The vocabulary of words and phrases is extensive, keeping things
    from getting boring through repetition.  You play against
    yourself, so at least you know the quality of the competition, although
    some players have been known to be surprised even then.
