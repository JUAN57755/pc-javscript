## Information about "LOCATE"

    LOCATE can help you quickly and conveniently locate files by searching
    for key words.  It has two programs: INDEX and LOCATE. INDEX scans all
    the files on a specified disk and builds an index, while LOCATE uses
    that index to make a list of files with the specified keywords.
    
    The program has some limitations -- it won't recognize less than three
    characters or more than seven.  It makes no distinction between words
    whose first seven characters are identical.  For example,
    ``complication'' and ``complicity'' would both be regarded as
    ``complic.'' To solve this problem, more than one word can be specified
    for the search criteria.
