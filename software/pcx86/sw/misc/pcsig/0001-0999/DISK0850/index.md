## Information about "INSURE, A HOME INSURANCE TRACKING SYSTEM"

    INSURE is a convenient way to track your all-important medical insurance
    claims with all functions needed with such records.  Menu-driven, it has
    instructions to guide you through every step.  It features convenient
    data entry, search-and-list functions, and instant print-out summaries.
    
    Keep a record of all your medical bills, and track how much money is
    paid by you and each insurance company.  Each claim entry includes who
    provided the service, the date on which the service was done, the
    patient's name, the charge, category, and comments.  The categorizing
    feature can be used, for example, when a policy has different maximum
    amounts that it will pay for different kinds of services.
    
    Calculate the total amount paid by a particular insurance plan for a
    particular kind of service.  This is useful at income tax time to
    calculate how much you paid for hospital expenses, doctor bills, etc.
    
    The shareware version of INSURE comes with sample entries, but will not
    retain more than seven entries.
    
    Usage: Home Insurance Tracking
    
    System Requirements: None.
    
    How to Start: Type INSURE (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration: $35.00 includes access to full version of the
    program, updates notices, and telephone support.
