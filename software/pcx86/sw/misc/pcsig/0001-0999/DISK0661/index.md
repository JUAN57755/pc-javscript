## Information about "RESICALC"

    RESICALC v.1.0 is a memory-resident calculator which can be "popped-up"
    whenever needed.  The matrix functions supported in RESICALC are called
    by an "expressionfunc(x)" where x is a matrix expression.  They
    include:
    
    ~ DIM returns the total number of components.
    ~ ROWS returns the number of rows.
    ~ COLS returns the number of columns.
    ~ CSUM returns a row vector whose components are the sum of columns.
    ~ RSUM returns a column vector whose components are the sum of rows.
    ~ CAVG returns a row vector whose components are the averages of
    columns.
    ~ RAVG returns a column vector whose components are the averages of
    rows.
    ~ CSUM2 returns a row vector whose components are the sum of squares of
    columns.
    ~ RSUM2 returns a column vector whose components are the sum of squares
    of rows.
    
    Of course, there are limits.  For example, it does not solve system of
    linear equations or inverts a matrix.  If you like it and want more,
    the same folks who built it have a more powerful MATRIX CALCULATOR,
    whose capabilities include linear programming calculations,
    differential equations, solution of system of linear and non-linear
    equations, etc.
    
    System Requirements:  128K, one disk drive and a monchrome display
    
    How to Start:  Check the README.DOC and MANUAL.DOC files for
    directions.  To bring up RESICALC, press the ALT and F9 keys together.
