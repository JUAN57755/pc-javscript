## Information about "MEMOIRS"

    We all need a private place to keep our thoughts and notes, a place
    safe from prying eyes.  At one time, it was a small book with a lock on
    it.  But with the advent of the computer era, a better way has been
    made.
    
    MEMOIRS is a private diary program that lets you encrypt your
    personal diary and store each encrypted line on disk as fast as it's
    typed.  MEMOIRS also lets you view the encryption taking place as you
    go.  The encryption method is quite fast and effective, with no
    redundant patterns -- thus making it virtually impossible to crack the
    code.
    
    MEMOIRS also encrypts and decrypts ASCII text files or documents.  As
    with the personal diary, you can watch the encryption taking place.
