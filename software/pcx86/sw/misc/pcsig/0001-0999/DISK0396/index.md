## Information about "PDS*BASE 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1025)"

    A complete hierarchical database system of the master/detail (or
    mother/daughter) type and, although written for BASIC programmers, is
    particularly well-suited to inventory systems, payroll or job control
    systems.
    
    A series of program generators create both a custom database (with up
    to 10 files) and BASIC programs to operate against the custom
    database. The generated programs can be easily modified. The system
    has excellent documentation and BASIC source code is included.
    
    This is the database management system for anyone who doesn't want to
    go to the expense and trouble of learning a new programming language.
