## Information about "RIDGETOWN COLLEGE"

    From Ridgetown College of Ontario comes this fine collection of farm
    management tools. Besides a handy metric conversion program, highlights
    include:
    
    LUMBER -- Welcome to the world of computer carpentry. Enter your basic
    design and constraints, if any. It produces reliable estimates of all
    the construction materials you will need for your project and keep a
    running total of the costs.
    
    USLE -- Deal with the problem of soil loss evaluation on irregular
    slopes with this program. Get a fast, accurate estimate of
    such soil loss. As many, if not most, fields have irregular
    slopes, the farmer/conservation specialist can benefit from
    this aid.
    
    WOODHEAT -- Explore the economics of using wood as a primary source of
    heating.
    
    The documentation also includes the code for Hewlett Packard (HP-41c)
    calculators.
