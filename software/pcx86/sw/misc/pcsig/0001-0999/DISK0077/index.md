## Information about "1RD"

    "1-RingyDingy" is a general purpose asynchronous communications program.
    It was designed with the "KISS" ("Keep It Simple, Stupid") principle in
    mind.  Although it employs a simple and straightforward approach to
    communications, its capabilities surpass those of some of the more
    expensive communications programs on the market today.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Communicate at speeds up to 9600 baud
    ~ Exchange (send or receive) text files with other computers
    ~ Exchange (send or receive) non-text (exe or com) files with
    other computers which support the "X-Modem" protocol
    ~ Use modems which don't support Auto-dial
    ~ Use modems which do support Auto-dial
    ~ Capture incoming data in a disk file
    ~ Setup your own "filters" to remove or change undesirable characters
    in the incoming data
    ~ Dynamically slow down the speed at which you transmit.
    ~ Dynamically alter your communications parameters, such as Parity,
    Speed,and number of data bits
    ~ Build automatic logon sequences of any length
    ~ Move back and forth between different directories on your hard disk
    
    Special Requirements:  Modem.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $25.00
