## Information about "BIBLE MEN"

    BIBLE MEN is a wonderful little quiz program that tests your finer
    knowledge of the Word. You begin by telling BIBLE MEN whether you want
    it to focus on either the Old or New Testament. Then it asks you for
    each player's name (up to eight). It gives you some significant
    passage, often written in first person, and asks you to identify the
    person. For example, it might give you this:
    
    "May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesephorus, because he
    often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains."
    
    You then type the name of the person referred to. (In the above
    example, the reference is to Onesephorus, the scripture is II Timothy
    1:16, and the author is the Apostle Paul.) When you don't know the
    answer, you can choose to see the verse, the answer, or move on to
    another question. You can look at the answers to a question and move
    on without affecting your score; scoring occurs only when you type an
    answer. BIBLE MEN displays your score as tries, wrong, right, and
    percent. Did you know the answer to the above example?
