## Information about "HYPERDRIVE"

    There are two different configurations of the HYPERDRIVE RAM-disk
    program on this disk, as well as the source code to let users generate
    their own configurations.  Note, however, that the documentation states
    that you must reset DIP switches on your system board to use this
    program.  Also included is an interesting BASIC program to figure
    future.  And for all you heretics who still believe that computers can
    be fun, too, a version of the game GOMOKU is included.  Translated into
    Pascal from HP Basic, this is guaranteed to keep you up late for a few
    nights.
    
    System Requirements:  Some programs require BASIC.
    
    How to Start: To run an EXE program simply type its name and press
    <ENTER>.  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please refer to
    the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.  For instructions on ASM
    listings, refer to your Assembler manual.  To read DOC files simply
    enter TYPE filename.ext and press <ENTER>.
