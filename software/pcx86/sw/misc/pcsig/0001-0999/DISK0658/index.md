## Information about "TOOLKIT UTILITIES"

    This diskette contains a small but excellent collection of programs
    which aid in DOS utilities and collectively are called "TOOLKIT."
    WC.EXE is an advanced word/char/line counter PLUS checksummer, which
    supports command line wildcards.  TC.EXE is an easy to read text
    compare program to find differences in a file.  INPATH.EXE is a file
    finder program with a twist: it locates files based upon the PATH
    variable, and uses the same extension hierarchy (COM-EXE-BAT) that DOS
    does; it is similar to "whereis" in the UNIX system.
    
    System Requirements:  128K, one disk drive and monochrome
    display.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO and press <enter> for startup instructions. To
    read DOC files simply enter TYPE filename.ext and press <ENTER>.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $5.00 gets you latest version and documentation
    $20.00 requested for commercial/government usage.
