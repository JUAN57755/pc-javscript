## Information about "DISK DRIVE-IN THEATER (VCR DBASE)"

    Here's the answer for anyone who needs a simple, structured way to keep
    track of all the movies and tapes they own.
    
    DISK DRIVE-IN THEATER has an ergonomic and efficient data-input screen
    (one of the easiest anywhere), and a wealth of reports and searches, all
    of which are accessible within three keystrokes.  Search by title, star,
    movie type, tape number, and retrieve data such as remaining room on
    tape.  Print two differently configured labels for your tape library.
    With all these features and a database controller faster than most, it
    is a clearly superior video library manager.
