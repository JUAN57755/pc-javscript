## Information about "LOGON AND LOGOFF"

    This disk is dedicated to a special category of utilities: programs
    for PC user logging, timekeeping and documenting job starting/ending.
    For example, PC-Logger gives you a computer use log that creates a PC
    FILE III database for later sort/print.  These types of utilities are
    a must for anyone who needs to document machine-time, for taxes or
    other reasons.
    
    How to Start:  To read DOC files, enter TYPE filename.ext and press
    <ENTER>.  To run an EXE or COM program, just type its name and press
    <ENTER>. For instructions on running BASIC programs, please refer to the
    GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.
    
    Suggested Registration:  SYSLOG has a suggested donation of $25.00
