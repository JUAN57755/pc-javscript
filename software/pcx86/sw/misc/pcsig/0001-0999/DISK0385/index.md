## Information about "PHRASE CRAZE"

    A word game that's great fun for the whole family. If you've ever seen
    ``Wheel of Fortune'' on TV, then you already know how to play PHRASE
    CRAZE.  (Sorry, Vanna is NOT included.)
    
    This is a phrase-guessing game where you fill in letters as outlined on
    the screen in a series of words that make up a well-known phrase.  Can I
    have an ``R'', please?
