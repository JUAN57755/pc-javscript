## Information about "FLOPCAT - DISK CATALOGING SYSTEM"

    FLOPCAT is a menu-driven disk-cataloging system with 23 functions to
    organize and manage your ever-increasing inventory of floppy disks.
    
    The disk labeling feature alone makes it well worth owning. Print
    labels with volume name, volume comment line, disk number, free bytes,
    file names and extensions. Build and update your catalog of disks.
    Look through the index or at the directory of a specific disk. Change
    the volume name, add a comment about the volume or make specific
    comments about individual files as you review the contents of each
    disk. Search through all floppy directories for volume names or wild
    card search strings. Volumes or files found are displayed on the
    screen or printer. A numerical or alphabetical listing of volumes is
    supported.
    
    Print a disk label in 3.5" or 5.25" formats. This function takes the
    directory information and neatly prints it on self-adhesive labels.
    This makes your selection of disks uniformly labeled, numbered, named,
    and dated, with the free bytes listed as well.
    
    New features include pop-up command windows, choice of file date
    record or comments, disk label path mask (allows labels to be printed
    only for selected drives), and expanded search functions.
