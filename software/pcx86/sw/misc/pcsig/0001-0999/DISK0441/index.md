## Information about "TEKTRONIX 4010"

    The program on this disk emulates a Tektronix 4010 storage tube
    display terminal, both full text and graphics.  The PC's screen may
    still be faster graphics (320 x 200), but all the detail is still
    there.  Also included is a DEC VT100 mode simulation.
    
    System Requirements:  64K, one disk drive and monochome display
    
    How to Start:  To run TekTerm use the command TEKTERM2 to call
    TEKTERM2.EXE.  A welcome screen will come up and then the main menu
    with a notation that no setup has been automatically loaded.  Type
    "L" for load setup and use the TT.CFG.
