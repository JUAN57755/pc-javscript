## Information about "HARD DISK MANAGEMENT"

    This disk is meant to be used with the book `"Hard Disk Management with
    MS-DOS and PC-DOS," from TAB Books. The book gives you tips on how to
    run your hard drive at top efficiency. The following programs are
    included on this disk:
    
    AUTOMENU -- This is the solution to learning all the DOS commands to
    access different programs.  No longer will you have to type in a list of
    commands to find the program you are looking for.  With a single press
    of a key, almost any program can be made available.  AUTOMENU gives you
    an easy-to-read and understandable menu of options to choose from.  It
    automatically does the commands to run the program you have selected.
    AUTOMENU also lets you set up your own customized menu systems.
    
    DISK TOOL -- This program lets you look at and make changes to what is
    stored on your disks.  You can work with individual files or the disk as
    a whole, and perform operations you normally couldn't do with DOS.  In
    short, it lets you manipulate everything on your disks easily and with
    very few restrictions.
    
    PACKDISK -- You can keep your hard disk running at top performance by
    filling those empty sections on your hard drive with data from the outer
    edges of your hard disk.  PACKDISK reintegrates lost clusters (file
    allocation units) into the available space on the disk and packs the
    root directory and subdirectories.  It also has other features, such as
    an option to delete an entire subdirectory with one easy command, a
    HIDE/UNHIDE program, and a program to create a RAM disk in your
    computer's memory.  And when you get to the point where you have too
    many subdirectories on your hard drive to keep track of, use the TREED
    program to map them all out on your screen.
    
    And for that valuable information on your hard drive that you don't want
    anyone to touch, there is the LOCK program.  This protects your data
    safely from accidental (or deliberate and unauthorized) viewing or
    editing.
