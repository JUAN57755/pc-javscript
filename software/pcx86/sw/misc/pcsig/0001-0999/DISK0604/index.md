## Information about "LANDING PARTY"

    Captain!! The energy crystals that power our life-support systems are
    failing! We need to locate new ones before we all die!  You'll have to
    count on your crew, now. Let's hope you chose them well.
    
    Your favorite movie stars, historical figures, friends and relatives can
    become characters in this text adventure game if you choose them before
    you become captain.  You must then deal with an assortment of monsters
    from the planet's surface before you can get those energy crystals you
    need so desperately. LANDING PARTY is menu-driven for ease of play.
    Individual games are short and different each time.
    
    Hurry, Captain! The air... I... I can't breathe....
    
    On the same disk is a two player trivia tic-tac-toe game. Each player
    must answer a trivia question to mark a square.
