## Information about "ANALYTICALC 1 OF 3 (ALSO 431, 432)"

    AnalytiCalc is a complete Spreadsheet/Database/Graphics/Word Processor
    program.  Written in FORTRAN, it is quite fast and has attractive
    features.  The author's goal is an inexpensive, highly integrated
    package.  The complete system comes on three disks.  Disk one is the
    primary disk for a computer that is limited to 256K memory.  Disk two
    is the supplemental disk with documentation and extra files.  Disk
    three is the primary disk for a computer with more than 320K memory.
    
    ALL THREE DISKS ARE NEEDED TO USE THE SYSTEM.  This is a complex
    package, and the user should be sure to read the documentation before
    using it.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Number of Columns......................................18000
    ~ Number of Rows.........................................18000
    ~ Maximum Length of Formulas (characters)..................109
    ~ Number of cells that can be full at once...............18000
    ~ Number of simultaneous named areas permitted.............300
    ~ Number of scratch cells outside spreadsheet...............60
    ~ Precision of calculations (digits; 8 bytes used)..........16
    ~ Total maximum storage managed (bytes)..............2,113,020
    ~ Maximum depth of document nesting (outline processor)......4
    ~ Maximum number of parameters varying to goal seek..........8
    ~ Maximum record size for data files accessed as database..128
    ~ Maximum number of files namable in one sheet..........>18000
    ~ Maximum cell columns displayable on one screen............20
    ~ Maximum number of rows displayable in one display.........75
    ~ Maximum simultaneous different cell display formats per
    sheet (taken from large set)...........................76
    ~ Length of format specification (characters)................9
    
    System Requirements:  256K, two disk drives and monochrome display
    
    How to Start: Read and print the document files ACSTART.DOC,
    README.DOC, MANUSQ.HLP, PKGINS.DOC, and ANALY.TUT.  MANUSQ.HLP will
    describe how to unsqueeze the manual file.  Unsqueeze it and read it
    before starting.  When you have read the manuals, boot Disk 1 and type
    ANALY to fire up the spreadsheet system.  Then run through the
    tutorial to get a feel for it.
