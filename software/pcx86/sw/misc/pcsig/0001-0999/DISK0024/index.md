## Information about "GAME SERIES NO 4"

    For children of all ages, PACKMAN (Sound familiar?) is a game in which
    the player moves a little computer character -- genus: Compchar;
    species: Packman -- through a maze of walls which the player is looking
    down on, and consumes the dots cluttering the hallways. While Packman
    is merrily gobbling along, he is being chased by a series of monsters
    giving all they have to gobble him up. His only defense is to eat one
    of four special power dots, which imbue him with the stuff to gobble
    his prospective gobblers. Anytime you gobble the gobblers, it's a good
    game.
    
    How to Start:  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please refer
    to the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.
