## Information about "SUPERNOVA - A TEXT ADVENTURE GAME"

    SUPERNOVA is an interactive text adventure set in the future.  As the
    dauntless adventurer, you will partake in an epic story that spans a
    galaxy and gives you the chance to save a civilization from an exploding
    star.
    
    You begin the game on a remote mining planet with little to look forward
    to except another back-breaking day in the mines.  From here on, you're
    on your own!
    
    A 16-color display keeps you abreast of your injuries, hunger and thirst
    levels, sickness, and weariness, and displays necessary diagrams and
    signs.  Sound effects are used throughout the game and over 1000 words
    are in the vocabulary.  Included is a nice touch -- a "clue" function
    when you are well and truly stuck.
    
    Now, if you're going to save a civilization, you'd better get started!
