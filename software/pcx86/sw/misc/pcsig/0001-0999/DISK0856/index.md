## Information about "FUNCTION KEY HELPER/FONT EDITOR/GROCERY"

    Make lists of the uses of function keys for various programs and add or
    edit a function-key template.  Many are already included on this disk --
    Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, WordPerfect, Multimate, PROCOMM, SuperCalc, RBBS,
    Turbo Lightning, and more.
    
    Once a template is created, you may print the function-key assignments
    for quick and easy reference.  Up to eight templates may be printed on a
    page and they include the Shift, Ctrl, and Alt-function key sequences
    in addition to the normal uses.
    
    Design and display your own special font characters.  Two font editors
    have been provided: one for medium-resolution modes and the other for
    high-resolution mode.
    
    After a font file is loaded or created, the entire font set is displayed
    at the bottom of the screen (all 128 characters) and the upper-right
    corner displays the bit mapping of a single font set.  You can edit each
    bit or pixel of a certain character.  The character can be rotated,
    moved, inverted, copied, and saved for future use.
    
    The upper-left corner contains a menu of function-key commands for easy
    reference.  Once you have created a font set to your satisfaction, you
    can access and use the file with Assembler, Pascal, C, BASIC or any
    other language that allows you to load the font file into a specific
    location in memory and then program DOS to acknowledge that location.
    
    FONT EDITOR will not only help you to create your own fonts, but it can
    also help you design game graphics characters that make moving screen
    objects easier and neater to code.
    
    Save your budget and your diet. Never go into a grocery store without a
    grocery list and don't deviate from it once you're in the store. Know
    what you need, go get it, and get out while you're still in control.
    How? Use GROCERY!
    
    The marketing specialists know that if we wander around without a
    specific idea of what to buy, we're more likely to "impulse buy."
    GROCERY keeps track of grocery items bought on a regular, or irregular,
    basis. Items are stored in aisles, and the program will handle up to
    30 aisles with 36 items in each. Duplicate the floorplan and layout of
    your favorite store. Once all the data is entered, you can print out the
    entire list or only the items that you select. The printout is quick
    and organized according to aisle.
    
    A few more words of advice -- never shop hungry and don't look at the
    aisle end-caps!
