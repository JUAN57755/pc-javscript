    Know what the stars have in store for you, your family and friends.
    ASTROL96 is a comprehensive astrology program that calculates the
    zodiacal positions of all of the planets and the sun, moon, and the 12
    house cusps for any date, time, and place. Display the aspects and
    midpoints between the planets, ascendant, and midheaven and
    midpoint/planet conjunctions.
    
    ASTROL96 lets you calculate a person's transits for up to one year.

    compatibility, as well as conduct rapid searches for compatible matches
    between charts.
