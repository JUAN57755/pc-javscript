## Information about "IN-CONTROL 2 OF 2 (ALSO 687)"

    IN-CONTROL is a well-rounded business prospect/contacts and activity-
    tracking system. It provides a Rolodex, activities list, management
    reports, expense reports and an appointments tickler.
    
    Everything is on-line with fast search capabilities.  The Rolodex
    features names, addresses and notations retrieval and a graphic
    ``layer-in'' ability which lets you temporarily merge mailing lists. In
    addition, it is network-ready.  The system also includes:
    appointments tracking, expenses, graphics, free-form data search,
    labels management and reports.  A built-in telephone dialing system
    uses your modem and frees your phone for incoming calls.  A built-in
    proposal and invoice generator is provided.  The program standardizes
    your prospecting and follow-up information and converts forgotten
    verbal commitments into a focused daily list of appointments and
    callbacks that nets you extra business.
    
    IN-CONTROL requires registration after you have placed 50 records in
    the Prospect file.  If not registered, this program will lock you out
    from access to the program, though the data files are always intact.
