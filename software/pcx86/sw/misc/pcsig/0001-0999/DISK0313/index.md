## Information about "BUSINESS SAMPLER #3"

    Time Management is the theme of this business collection.  Highlights
    include: the PC Yearbook which is a calendar/appointment schedule
    program written in C; it also includes a notepad.  IPM.COM is a
    (Critical Path Method) project scheduler written in Turbo Pascal.
    This is a methodology for determining the critical task that, if not
    accomplished by a certain time, contributes directly to the delay of
    the whole project.  It does not have a calendar function or a project
    tracking function.
    
    UserLog is a system utility designed to maintain a disk-based file of
    computer usage, thus eliminating the need for a written log that
    monitors the business and personal use of a computer.  Program Time
    calculates the amount of computer time used.  It allows apportionment
    of the time between business and non-business use.
    
    System Requirements:  BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for directions and
    documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in
    GETTING STARTED for your configuration.  To run a program suffixed
    .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e., for IPM.COM, type IPM <ENTER>.
