## Information about "ADVENTURE AND MUSIC COLLECTION"

    You are in a spaceship exploring the Orion Nebula for NASA.  Your
    mission is to explore the three closest planets to your spaceship and
    collect one animal, one vegetable, and one mineral.  How will you be
    able to tell?  If you encounter an intelligent life form, how will you
    know?  NASA has instructed you to capture it alive.  Good luck!
    
    A text adventure game that takes you to the heart of Africa. In DARK
    CONTINENT, you are on a safari expedition in search of King Solomon's
    legendary diamond. Unfortunately, your native followers have mutinied
    and left you lost in the wilderness without a map. Not only must you
    find the diamond, but also, your way back to England. (And try not to
    get eaten by wildlife on the way!)

    "The Frozen Logger," and "Happy Endings on the Banks of Ohio."

    instruments with an electronic tuner.  Instructions are included in the
