## Information about "PULLED FROM THE LIBRARY"

    MANAGEX I is based on the idea that it is best to send a statement to
    each client at some regular interval.  Even when nothing is due from the
    client during that period, a statement should be sent, just to let the
    client know you're thinking of him.
    
    The minimum period for which a client can be billed with MANAGEX I is
    one calendar month.  Each bill includes all transactions from the
    beginning of the first month covered by the bill to the end of the last
    month covered.
