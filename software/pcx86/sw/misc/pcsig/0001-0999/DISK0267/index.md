## Information about "DATA BASE OF STEEL 3 OF 4 (214,215,268)"

    This is the first volume of Potomac Engineering's database, spreadsheet
    and expert system offerings, all grouped under the title "... of
    Steel".  The first two disks contain the Database Management System
    which includes Accounting, Payroll, Inventory, and A/R Applications
    Programmable, Relational.  The documentation for the whole system is on
    Disk No 215.
    
    The Spreadsheet (No 267) includes 21 ways to calculate numbers or write
    your own subroutine.  It is written in BASIC for easy modification, and
    a compiled version is available.
    
    The Expert System (No 268) provides for inference engines, designing
    your own expert systems, and intelligent search patterns.  The entire
    system is menu driven, so all the options are displayed on the screen.
