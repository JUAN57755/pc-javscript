## Information about "CARD TRAK, EGA SCREEN SAVE, AND MORE"

    A screen-blanking routine that shuts your EGA screen off after three
    minutes of keyboard inactivity.  This helps prolong the life of your
    screen by preventing ``image burn-in''.  Striking any key restores your
    video display.
    
    MONTAGE2 is in this library for one reason: it's fun.  It presents a
    colorful line display rivaled only by '60s music videos -- a good way to
    show off your EGA system.  You configure parameters that determine the
    color and pattern of the lines.  It's self-documented with a help
    display during execution.
    
    LOTTOPIKS is a random number generator for playing six-number format
    state lottos.  It sorts the numbers into ascending order and displays a
    screen of games.  The Illinois and Missouri lottos are menued for the
    basic games, but other states' games can be easily configured with the
    program by setting that game's maximum high number (6 to 255).
