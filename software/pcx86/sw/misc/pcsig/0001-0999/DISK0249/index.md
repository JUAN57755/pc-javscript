## Information about "EQUATOR AND PC-TOUCH"

    EQUATOR's purpose is to help you learn the function, use, and
    application of various general purpose formulas used in the fields of
    finance, math and science.  It consists of 63 equations divided equally
    among the three subjects.  Each equation appears on its own menu-driven
    screen or worksheet.  EQUATOR is designed to let you experiment with
    each equation as much as you like.  The more you work with an equation,
    the easier it is for you to understand it, remember it, and use it at
    home or at school.
    
    The following are some of the equations in the math menu of EQUATOR:
    
    ~ Area of a square, rectangle, circle, and triangle
    
    ~ Hypotenuse of a right triangle
    
    ~ Circumference of a circle
    
    ~ Volume and surface area of a cylinder
    
    ~ Volume and surface area of a cone
    
    ~ Volume and surface area of a sphere

    PC-TOUCH is a typing tutor with varying levels of difficulty ranging
    from the very easy, for the beginner, to the difficult, for the expert
    who wants to brush up his or her typing skills. The program gives you
    the line to type into the system, and all your statistics -- typing
    speed, errors, and test-adjusted scores -- are maintained along the
    bottom of the screen.
