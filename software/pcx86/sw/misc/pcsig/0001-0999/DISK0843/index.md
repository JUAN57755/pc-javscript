## Information about "OMEGA-LINK"

    OMEGA-LINK is a communications program for the modem, which can be
    configured to suit your needs.  Configure the communication
    parameters, file names, modem and printer, buffer sizes, windows and
    colors.  Commands are easy-to-use, and can be viewed on a pop-up menu.
    There are 50 user-definable macros for frequently-used command
    sequences.  An on-screen clock will help you keep track of how much
    time you spend on the phone lines.
    
    OMEGA-LINK has extensive file functions to view a file, rename a file,
    change attributes, or delete a file.  Any directory listing will show
    all files on the disk, including hidden files, read-only files, and
    subdirectories.  Create or delete a subdirectory and show the amount of
    disk space available.  Change the path and default drive, and shell to
    DOS.  ANSI graphics can be toggled on or off and sessions can be
    *captured onto disk.
    
    OMEGA-LINK has several built-in file transfer protocols.  These
    protocols include: ASCII, XMODEM and YMODEM.  If these aren't enough,
    there is an external protocol handler that allows you to add
    additional protocols such as ZMODEM, WXMODEM and KERMIT.
