## Information about "COMPOSER BY OAK TREE SOFTWARE"

    If you're like most people, you've always had the urge to create music.
    But for some reason you never picked up that first instrument and
    really learned how to play it.  COMPOSER makes your computer that first
    instrument.
    
    COMPOSER is a graphics-based music editor that lets you compose, edit,
    play, save, and print single-voice music on your PC.  Since COMPOSER is
    a graphics-based editor, you can actually see the notes that make up
    your music.  You do not have to work with a confusing mixture of
    letters and numbers.  Once your music looks correct on the screen and
    sounds correct, you can print your music with any dot matrix printer.
    
    COMPOSER is easy to use and very flexible.  If you have a PCjr, or
    compatible three-voice machine, COMPOSER can also create music files
    that later can be combined to make three-part sound.  This lets you
    create harmony and chords.
    
    COMPOSER's editing features make music entry easy.  By using COMPOSER's
    block insert and delete mode, you can manipulate large sections of music
    quickly.  Includes Beethoven's Symphony Number 5 and Minuet in G, John
    Phillip Sousa's Stars and Stripes Forever, and Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf
    Rag.
