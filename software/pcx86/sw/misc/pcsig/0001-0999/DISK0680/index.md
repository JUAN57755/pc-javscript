## Information about "FORGE A FORMS GENERATER"

    FORGE is a Turbo Pascal and dBase III programmer's aid. it allows the
    programmer to design data input forms or help screens, then generate
    Turbo Pascal or dBase III source code for those forms. This source code
    can then be compiled and used as is for data entry, or it can be
    included as a procedure within a larger more comprehensive
    program.  Since this is a utility for Turbo Pascal and dBase III,
    a working knowledge of these programming languages is assumed.
    
    The concept of FORGE is somewhat analogous to word processing. with a
    word processor you can write, review, change, insert, delete and
    otherwise perfect your text before committing it to its final form.
    FORGE allows you to do the same thing with a data input form or
    information screen. Some of the outstanding features of FORGE are that
    you can: fill an area on the screen with color, without affecting the
    characters that are already on the screen, insert or delete lines from
    the screen, define areas on the form for entering data, define data
    entry areas as "string", "integer", or "real" data types, use IBM
    graphics characters to "draw" boxes etc., and use blinking characters.
    
    System Requirements:  TURBO Pascal 2.0 or higher.
    
    How to Start:  Type FORGE (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $20.00
