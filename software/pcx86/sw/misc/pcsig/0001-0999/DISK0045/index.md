## Information about "GAME SERIES NO 8"

    A wide ranging example of ``games that were.''  If you're interested in
    BASIC programming, this could be an interesting set of programs to
    analyze.  You might want to find out how to do a certain procedure, or
    adapt a given procedure to your own BASIC project.  You'll find ample
    and diverse examples of game procedures in this package.
    
    There are several educational games on this disk, plus a couple that
    will still keep you guessing.  However, the games on this list are
    essentially out of date now, and, given the advances in programming over
    the years, there are many more up-to-date variations on the themes
    available in the PC-SIG library.
