## Information about "PEOPLESYSTEMS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 972)"

    More than just programs and data come on disks nowadays.  The
    controversial new book ``Damn the Trivia'' fills two disks about
    Peoplesystems (PS) -- the methods for tomorrow, that control our lives
    today.
    
    Systems sort into two categories -- systems for people -- Peoplesystems
    (PS) and systems for things -- technology.  There are also hybrid or
    mixed systems, but it's easier to first understand the pure, simple
    forms before looking at the more complex.
    
    Peoplesystems (PS) are simple patterns of people events that guide,
    control or affect our daily lives.  This book shows how to create better
    Peoplesystems that will free us from old fashioned ideas.
