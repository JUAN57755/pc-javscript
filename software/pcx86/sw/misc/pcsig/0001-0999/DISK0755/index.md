## Information about "CANTONESE TUTOR"

    Cantonese is an extremely hard-to-learn language spoken by more people
    than any other language in the world.  This program can help you learn
    it.  It is menu-driven, with menus for both the student and teacher.
    Lessons can be tailored by the teacher for drilling in certain areas.
    
    CANTONESE is designed for use with other forms of Chinese language
    study, since it does not provide actual spoken Cantonese as an example.
    The documentation can be somewhat difficult to follow at times, but has
    all the needed information to run the program.
