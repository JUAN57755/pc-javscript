## Information about "PCLOAN5"

    PCLOAN 5 was designed by a retired bank president who negotiated,
    originated and collected over 30,000 commercial loans.
    
    PCLOAN 5 provides analysis data for amortizing loans with output
    to the screen, disk or printed reports.  Perform almost any
    calculation needed for a business or personal loan which is amortized
    in multiple payments. It is menu-driven and includes quite a bit of
    on-line help.
    
    Use PCLOAN 5 functions to project just what a loan is going to cost and
    when.  Know what you're getting into, financially, before you take that
    final plunge.
