## Information about "LEDGER EXPRESS, REQUIRES LOTUS 1-2-3"

    LEDGER EXPRESS is a menu-driven, macro-programmed demonstration disk of
    a general ledger accounting system for use with Lotus 1-2-3.  The
    application extracted transactions from the 1GJRL.WKS into Extract
    files and then posts the sorted and extracted information to the
    respective ledger accounts.  The application has a feature to print the
    ledger accounts during posting and also has an account balance
    extraction feature for posting to the balance sheet.
    
    Although LEDGER EXPRESS is a demonstration, the experienced macro
    programmer should be able to use this demo as a guide for producing
    their own application.
    
    The complete application is available for $49.95 for those desiring
    INSTALLATION worksheets, subsidiary ledger worksheets
    (payables/receivables), and a complete system for financial statements.
    
    System Requirements:  Lotus 1-2-3.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  $49.95
