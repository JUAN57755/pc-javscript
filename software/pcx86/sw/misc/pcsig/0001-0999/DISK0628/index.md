## Information about "BIBLEQ"

    BIBLE-Q is a trivia-type game with 600 multiple-choice questions drawn
    from the Bible (600 more available with registration). Bible students
    and teachers of the church school variety will certainly want this in
    their collections.
    
    Test youself and others on a wide range of topics including geography of
    the Biblical lands, personalities, incidents, and teachings of the
    Gospels. Players can choose the category and difficulty level of the
    question. Combine with WORDWORKER (PC-SIG disk #'s 581, 582) and you
    have the foundation for an excellent on-line scripture study system.
