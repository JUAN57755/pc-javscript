## Information about "PC-PROMPT"

    PC-PROMPT is a unique, memory-resident DOS help program that
    automatically provides information for DOS commands as you type them.
    The F10 function key can display additional help whenever needed. Help
    screens can also be invoked for EDLIN, DEBUG, BASIC and Borland's Turbo
    Pascal editor.
    
    Since PC-PROMPT is memory-resident, it stays loaded in memory until you
    reboot the PC. It automatically activates at the DOS prompt, and
    deactivates whenever you execute any DOS command, batch file, or
    program. Because of this, it is compatible with most software, even
    with programs which do direct screen memory operations without using
    DOS. It is even compatible with various other memory-resident programs
    such as RAM drive emulators, printer spoolers, and Borland's SideKick.
