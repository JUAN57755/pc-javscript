## Information about "ADDRESS MANAGER"

    ADDRESS MANAGER helps you keep multiple databases of names, addresses,
    phone numbers, and useful comments.  You can add new entries and delete
    or update current ones easily.
    
    The program is especially designed to address envelopes -- always a
    problem area, as well as print labels and even entire mailing lists.
    Labels can be printed on sheets from one to four across, and all
    entries can be sorted by zip code before printing.
    
    ADDRESS MANAGER menus are function-key driven.  On-line help is
    available from each menu.  This provides a quick and user-friendly
    interface, one that is easy to learn and use.
