## Information about "TEACHER'S DATABASE FOR THE CLASSROOM"

    TEACHER'S DATABASE is designed particularly for teachers to organize
    information on their students.  The database can track up to 500
    students, each student having as many as 80 individual items of data in
    his record.
    
    Store names and addresses, alphabetize or reorder records based on their
    contents, sort by homerooms or subjects, and print individual student
    progress reports, class gradebook sheets, and student seating charts.
    
    Student test scores may be weighted, averaged, statistically analyzed,
    changed to a percentage or a letter grade.  Graphs of student test
    results may be created using the computer's high-resolution graphic
    screen.  Grade distribution can be displayed numerically or as a
    histogram.  A spreadsheet-style editor makes data entry and editing a
    snap.
    
    Let the computer do the paperwork while you focus on teaching.  After
    all, that's why you became a teacher.
