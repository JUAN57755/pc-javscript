## Information about "FOLLIES"

    This GAMES disk has 8 programs which will give you hours of fun and
    relaxation.  ROULETTE and KENO might be used to develop your own
    system of beating the casinos.  The 3-D TIC-TAC-TOE and the
    OTHELLO games are great fun, for they match your wits against
    the computer.  The PC-OTHELLO game is meant to be played by two
    computer users over the telephone.  If you are a serious internals
    person with experience in Assembly you may find COREWAR to be both
    fun and a learning experience.  The BIORHYTHMS charting program is very
    good.  All in all, a nice collection of computer games.
