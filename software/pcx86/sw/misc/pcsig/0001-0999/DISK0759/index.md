## Information about "WRITER'S HEAVEN AND MOREPERFECT"

    WRITER'S HEAVEN transforms the popular wordprocessing program PC-Write
    into one of the fastest and most efficient editing tools today.
    
    WRITER'S HEAVEN, using PC-WRITE's own macro feature, grafts a unique
    keyboard structure onto PC-WRITE itself.  The result is a
    wordprocessor that combines speed, power, simplicity, and ease of
    learning -- a wordprocessor that brings on-screen editing significantly
    closer to the speed of thought.  While most of the principal PC-WRITE
    command keys remain intact as an alternate command set, you can now edit
    text without ever moving your hands from the typewriter position, and
    you can do it faster than ever before.
    
    Here is a utility program WordPerfect fans should have.  MOREPERFECT
    adds to the word processing program a new set of command keys in an
    ingenious arrangement.  With a single keystroke, you can move the cursor
    or delete--by character, word, line, sentence, paragraph, or page--
    forward or backward--without moving your hands from the letter keys!
    MOREPERFECT can double your editing speed, yet it's easy to learn and
    use.
