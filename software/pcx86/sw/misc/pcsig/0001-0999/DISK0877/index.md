## Information about "BARCODE, HYDE, AND DOVETAIL III"

    You've seen them everywhere: on your soda can, at the grocery store, on
    the TV guide -- those groups of lines with numbers under them. BARCODE
    allows you to print these bar code labels on your printer. It is
    designed to print code three of nine, a type of bar code which allows
    both alphabetic and numeric characters. Labels can be printed up to 15
    characters in length.
    
    Define the placement of the bar codes, place a description over each
    code, print single or multiple copies of one bar code, or print a run of
    sequentially-numbered bar codes. BARCODE can hold three different
    printer configurations, and can switch between these configurations with
    one key stroke. The three configurations can be modified to accommodate
    a multitude of printers and are pre-configured for IBM graphics, APA
    graphics, and Epson graphics printers.
    
    Protect your data -- HYDE allows you to hide/unhide files. When you
    hide a file, it won't be accessible by DOS until you use the unhide
    program.
    
    DOVETAIL III merges a form letter with addresses from a mailing list and
    even addresses envelopes.  It works with mailing lists and form letters
    written with WordStar, Easywriter or PerfectWriter.  Source code is in
    BASIC and the executable program file is also included.
    File Descriptions:
    
    IIIDOCMT BAS  BASIC source code of the documentation.
    IIIDOCMT EXE  Compiled version of the documentation.
    IIIDOVE  BAS  The main program in BASIC source code.
    IIIDOVE  EXE  Compiled version of the main program.
    SAMPL*** WS   Sample file written with WORDSTAR (3 files).
    UNWS     EXE  Utility file to remove WORDSTAR buried commands.
