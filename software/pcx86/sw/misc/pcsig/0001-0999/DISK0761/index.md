## Information about "THE IMP SHELL"

    IMP SHELL is a powerful expert system for the IBM-PC. It has
    all the utilities needed to develop, test, and run new
    expert systems.
    
    An expert system is a program that has captured the expertise in some
    field and can deploy that expertise with seemingly intelligent
    behavior. This shell is useful for diagnostic problems -- whether
    you're an auto mechanic with a client whose car keeps stalling, or a
    test engineer with a batch of wafers that for some reason just won't
    pass QC. IMP SHELL can speed up your diagnosis process considerably.
    The IMP SHELL's functions are menu-driven and appear in windows. IMP
    expert systems are rule-based, backwards-chaining systems. They are
    very fast and not limited by an artificially small number of rules. It
    is especially good for classification tasks, troubleshooting, and
    alternative selection. It does not, however, have the proper
    architecture for applications that need a well-defined sequence of
    complex steps -- applications such as cost estimation or equipment
    configuration. These should be done on a forward-chaining shell.
