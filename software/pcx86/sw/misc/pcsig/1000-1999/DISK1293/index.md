## Information about "GAMESCAPE, SPACE SLUG, MAROONED & RING"

    GAMESCAPE is the fantastic program that allows you to design and
    distribute your own adventure games!  GAMESCAPE is a powerful "adventure
    engine" that allows you to describe locations and rooms, objects,
    recognizable words, messages, and occurrences that happen within the
    game.  You can also include sound, music, and any of the standard IBM
    special graphics characters!  GAMESCAPE encodes information so your game
    secrets cannot be deciphered by end users, and allows games to be
    "linked" so your adventures can be of any length.
    
    Once the game is finished, registered users are allowed to distribute
    the games without worrying about any kind of distribution fee--the
    initial registration is all that's required!
    
    RINGWIELDER is an incredible non-computer role-playing game that
    features the worlds of both fantasy and science fiction!  The full set
    of rules is included on this disk in text form.
    
    In a "role-playing game," you take on the characteristics of someone (or
    something) from the realm of fantasy or science fiction and play the
    game as if you are that character.  While RINGWIELDER uses both the
    worlds of fantasy and science, the occult and extreme violence so
    prevalent in other games are ommitted.  This provides a viable
    alternative to those who are offended by such things.
    
    RINGWIELDER is easy to play and fast-moving.  The rules are easy to
    understand, but interesting enough to hold the interest of even the most
    advanced gamer.  The entire rule section is contained within this disk,
    along with an offer to obtain the official, hard-bound collectors-item
    book and club membership!
    
    MAROONED AGAIN is not your standard text adventure.  It's logical.  It
    tells you this every time you try to do something illogical.  The basic
    plot:  You are marooned on an alien planet with a broken spaceship and a
    bunch of retarded clones who can only respond to two-word commands.
    There is hope however!  Also on this planet is an alien spaceship that
    can be made to work with some minor repairs.  All you have to do is use
    the clones to fix the alien ship, and take off.
    
    MAROONED AGAIN is lots of fun, and does not bear the irritating
    "irrational" nature found in so many adventure games.  This game has
    been highly acclaimed by our users, so much so that it even has a
    sequel!
    
    The classical game of WORMS with nothing special added--except blinding
    speed. The speed level is adjustable from very easy to absolutely
    impossible. This makes it more fun to play than previously existing
    games which typically offered only one speed level. This game uses
    joystick or keyboard input.
    
    GIANT SPACE SLUG is excellent for building eye-hand coordination,
    especially among children. It utilizes all four directions of the
    screen, not just the typical back-and-forth motion of most arcade-type
    games. This game has been most popular among parents wanting good games
    for their children. It works on monochrome as well as color monitors.
