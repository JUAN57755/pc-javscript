## Information about "QUICK CHECK BOOK 1 OF 2 (1731 ALSO)"

    Balancing your checkbook and savings accounts can now be a breeze, with
    QUICK CHECK BOOK. QUICK CHECK BOOK is a menu driven program that
    smooths the effort of maintaining a checkbook, paying bills, sticking to
    a budget, and writing checks.
    
    The absence of accounting terminology, account numbers, and confusing
    methods make QUICK CHECK BOOK the perfect solution for those who like to
    keep things simple and smart. Each menu selection has a pop-up help
    window.
    
    QUICK CHECK BOOK has no limit to the number of checkbooks it can
    maintain, or the number of transactions in a checkbook. The amount of
    storage space available determines your limitations on the number of
    checkbooks and transactions.
    
    QUICK CHECK BOOK is usable in various ways. If you want to write
    checks, it does so on your checks and your printer. If you only want to
    maintain a check database or budget, QUICK CHECK BOOK does that too.
    Balancing with the bank will no longer be the source of anguish. To
    balance with the bank, you simply confirm a transaction amount against
    your bank statement by pressing the return/enter key. QUICK CHECK BOOK
    does the rest.
    
    A calculator, calendar, and other utilities are always a key stroke or
    two away. Mouse support is also available.
