## Information about "ERB, MINIMUF, HIGH POINT (DIVERSLOG 2050"

    EXTERIOR RIFLE BALLISTICS (ERB) is an aid for those sportsmen who reload
    their own ammunition.
    
    Determine expected bullet rise if the target is before the adjusted ZERO
    point, and bullet drop downrange beyond the adjusted ZERO point.  It
    saves deciphering of ballistic tables to estimate the correct
    combination of powder and primer for a bullet.
    
    A MUF calculator for the amateur radio operator.
    
    MINIMUF computes the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) for specified paths
    for a 24-hour period given in GMT (UTC).  The program gives the MUF for
    one path and draws a graph.  You can select from 15 pre-programmed
    paths or you can enter the latitude and longitude coordinates for any
    path in a setup data file.  The graph is displayed in the text mode so
    it can be printed on all IBM compatible printers.
    
    HIGH POINTS belongs at your next meet or sporting event.  Designed to
    assist in judging competitive events, it calculates and provides judges
    (and journalists) with tallies and standings, instantly.
    
    The program handles events of one to 10 rounds with up to 400
    participants grouped by one to 10 classes.  The data entry screen is
    self explanatory and the documentation contains many useful hints and
    precautions for the actual events.
    
    Save data to a file or print results of a round or current standings at
    any time.  There is even a supplementary program to help resolve ties
    when the judges are required to include secondary criteria.
