## Information about "PC-DASHBOARD"

    PC-DASHBOARD is a program menu system to make the operation of programs
    on a hard disk much easier and quicker.  The program consists of a main
    menu and a virtually unlimited number of submenus, and each menu can
    have up to 24 choices.  From the menus you can perform DOS commands,
    execute your favorite programs, go to other submenus, or shell to a
    specific directory.
    
    PC-DASHBOARD allows you to customize your own menu choices and easily
    design a system of submenus to suit your own needs.  You can type in
    your own personalized menu prompt for each entry used to execute a
    program.  Once you have also included a directory path, a command, and
    an optional password, your menu choice is created, and all you have to
    do is type in the letter of the entry to execute the program.
    
    You can design your menu entry to include up to 10 separate commands,
    giving you the capability to execute multiple programs or commands in
    succession from a single menu entry if you so desire.  You can also
    design a command so that it prompts the user for more information to
    complete the command.  Besides all this, PC-DASHBOARD lets you
    change the screen colors, turn the automatic screen blank (four min.),
    on or off, edit the menu titles and the on-screen notes, and choose the
    number of columns (1-4) for each menu.
    
    PC-DASHBOARD's effective password protection system extends to the
    option to change the settings of the menus, exit from the program to
    DOS, specific menu entries, or access to entire submenus.  In this way,
    several people can use the same computer yet have only restricted
    access
    to the system.
    
    PC-DASHBOARD simplifies the operation of programs on your hard disk and
    controls the access to them.
