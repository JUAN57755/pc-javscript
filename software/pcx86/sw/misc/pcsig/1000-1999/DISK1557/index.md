## Information about "PC-SPEEDY MAILER"

    Have you ever wondered how those credit agencies, schools, and other
    businesses get the carbon envelope message mailers produced?  Well
    wonder no more because it's easier than you might think.
    
    PC-SPEEDY MAILER is a self-prompting menu-driven program which supports
    the development, printing, and addressing of continuous feed message
    mailers measuring 5 1/2" x 8 1/2".  With PC-SPEEDY MAILER you may
    create
    a mailer message consisting of up to thirteen lines consisting of 60
    characters.  This message may be edited, saved to a disk file, and be
    recalled at a later time for editing or printing.
    
    With PC-SPEEDY MAILER, businesses can recognize a significant saving in
    mail costs when communicating with clients.  In a matter of minutes a
    message can be typed and printed for mailing.  There is no need for art
    work production, printing, and envelope stuffing.  The cost of labor and
    materials savings can be significant.
    
    PC-SPEEDY MAILER was designed as a companion program to PC-POSTCARD.
    During printing, the user may merge address files developed with this
    program.
    
    PC-MAILER was designed for use by the inexperienced because little is
    required of the new user.  It makes liberal use of
    information and help screens, is menu-based, and is interactive with the
    user.
    
    With PC-MAILER, your computer will become a powerful tool for
    maintaining contacts with friends, clients, and business associates.
