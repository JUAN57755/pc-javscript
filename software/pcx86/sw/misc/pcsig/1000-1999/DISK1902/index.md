## Information about "HACKER"

    Want to write truly interactive and intelligent batch files?  HACKER
    can add a whole new dimension to batch file programming.
    
    HACKER is a multi-function utility for programmers.  It communicates
    with both the user and the system, and performs many useful tasks. Most
    HACKER functions are for use within batch files, but command line
    processing is also supported.  HACKER returns information to a batch
    file through DOS's errorlevel.
    
    HACKER functions include:
    
    ~ ASK a question from the user,
    
    ~ BOOT causes a warm or cold re-boot,
    
    ~ CLEAR clears selected portions of the screen,
    
    ~ FIX changes the shape of the cursor,
    
    ~ IS gives drive/directory control.
    
    ~ NOTE sends notes to the screen,
    
    ~ SHOW lists hidden files and directories,
    
    ~ SOUND gives ability to produce tones or music,
    
    ~ WAIT adds time delays,
    
    ~ WHAT provides information about date/time/drive/mode.
    
    HACKER also provides an extensive on-line help command that explains the
    use of each function.
