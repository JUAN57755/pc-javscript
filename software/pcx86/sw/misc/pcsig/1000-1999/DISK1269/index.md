## Information about "HOGBEAR ADVENTURE GAME"

    The next time you are walking, hear laughter, and notice a nearby
    mansion, run for your life.  If the HOGBEAR lures you in, you have to
    face him, a vampire, blue devils, killer bees, an ogre, a bear, pecking
    falcons and other perils.
    
    If you are swift, wiser than most, and persistent, you might even
    overcome the snake and spider as you roam about the huge mansion.  As in
    life, some games are unwinnable.  But there's hope.  This text
    adventure/graphics game moves quickly when you learn the knack of
    searching and gathering the tools and weapons you need.  Otherwise, you
    lurch about from room to darkened room, stumbling toward certain doom in
    an obscure mansion filled with deadly surprises.
    
    An update of the classic game Castle, HOGBEAR is fun for all ages.  It
    runs on both color and monochrome systems.
