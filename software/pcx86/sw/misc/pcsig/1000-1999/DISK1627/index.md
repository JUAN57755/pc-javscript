## Information about "ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS"

    ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (EIS) is an electronic bulletin board and
    more. You get more than a way for people to call and put up
    messages and read those posted by others. EIS is a complete
    information retrieval system. It is an invaluable electronic mail and
    communication tool for small businesses and BBS operators with a
    complete security system to prevent intrusion.
    
    EIS offers compatibility with many of the utilities and games written
    for a slew of other BBS systems. EIS offers support for the PCRelay BBS
    networking software, and offers support for a multi-node system.
    Supported file transfer protocols include Xmodem, Xmodem-CRC, Xmodem-1K,
    True Ymodem Batch, and Zmodem CRC-32 with MobyTurbo and Crash Recovery.
    EIS operates at baud rates from 300 to 38,400 bps on any com port that
    you have available. The ANSI Message editor will allow your user to do
    full-screen message entry and editing. EIS can run up to 10,000 nodes
    on a local area network.
    
    EIS will manage an unlimited number of message bases and file areas and
    can hold about two billion messages in each message base. EIS is 100%
    compatible with the MegaMail Off-line reader, and with the PCRelay BBS
    networking system. EIS will run doors designed to run with about 30
    different BBS systems.
    
    Installation is a breeze, there is no complicated copying or editing
    necessary to get a fully-functional system on-line. Installation
    involves putting the disk in the A: drive and typing INSTALL. Before
    you know it, you will be logging into your own BBS.
    
    EIS is perfect for your small business, too. There is a secure E-Mail
    system and support for general message bases. You can display catalogs
    and take orders. You can keep secure and public file directories of
    files for your customers and staff to download. Your customers will
    love having BBS support, and your staff will love to be able to call in
    and grab that file they forgot at the office or send secure E-Mail.
    
    If you want, you can emulate a traditional BBS. Or you can configure
    your system to be unique from every other information system on the
    market today and to match your own specific needs. If you are looking
    into BBS or information retrieval systems for any reason, EIS is exactly
    what you are looking for.
