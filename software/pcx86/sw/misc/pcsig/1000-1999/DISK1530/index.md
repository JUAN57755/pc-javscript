## Information about "PHONE MESSAGE & COMTRAC"

    PHONE MESSAGE is a memory-resident utility that allows you to quickly
    record phone messages.  Once the program is installed in memory, press
    the "hot-key" to activate this handy phone jotter.  A small screen will
    appear allowing you to record who the phone call is for, who sent the
    phone call, the phone number of the caller, and a short message.  All
    the information is then automatically transferred to an ASCII text file
    for later viewing or editing.
    
    COMTRAC keeps track of your appointments, commitments, phone calls, and
    letters to other companies.  It is the perfect support program for sales
    prospecting, or coordinating other business-to-business activities.  The
    program can work with your modem to perform autodialing and log the time
    spent on each phone call.
    
    COMTRAC maintains records on each company you deal with and organizes
    such information as the company name, the address, two phone numbers,
    the SIC number, the product, and whom to contact.  Within a split
    second you can search for and find a company's record which includes
    logs of your last 15 phone calls, letters, and appointments with the
    contact.  Each record also has a six-month, three-month, and one-month
    calendar showing your commitments, scheduled meetings, etc., with the
    company.
    
    You can export any of this information to your wordprocessor to create
    form letters, Rolodex cards, envelopes and mailing labels.  COMTRAC can
    also print reports such as the day's and week's appointments, a list of
    client companies, a telephone list, a phone log, and a letter log.
