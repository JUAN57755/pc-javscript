## Information about "PHOTO PACK"

    PHOTO PACK is a collection of programs for amateur and professional
    photographers guaranteed to improve your picture taking skills.
    
    With PHOTO PACK, your PC helps you pick the right filters (called
    diopter lenses) for closeup photography, calculates your camera's
    settings for shooting moving objects, determine film image size for
    printing pictures, figures enlarger head to paper distance for blowing
    up an image, and calculates proper flash settings and depth-of-field
    information.
    
    Impressed?  Well, zoom in on this: PHOTO PACK also turns your PC into a
    darkroom processing timer, a label maker, and a negative/slide database.
    It also prints model releases!
    
    The TIMER can be programmed to handle up to 16 separate processing
    steps.  These steps may run in a darkroom or in a ``lights-on'' mode.
    The darkroom mode uses a black screen background with red digits.  You
    can set tones or ``beeps'' to help you with developing and printing.
    
    The LABEL MAKER prints return address labels, equipment identification
    labels, slide labels, or whatever other labels you can think of.
    
    The DATABASE helps you keep track of all those shoeboxes full of
    slides and negatives.  Describe your transparencies with multiple
    keywords in different categories.  Later, retrieve photos by category
    and keyword.  Each database can hold 65,000 records.  If you use floppy
    disks for your database, you can use multiple disks for an unlimited
    number of records.  (NOTE: You can average from around 1400 to 1800
    records per floppy disk.)
