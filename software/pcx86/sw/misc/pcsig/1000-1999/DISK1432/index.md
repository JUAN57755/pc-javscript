## Information about "RADIO REPAIR & RADIATION"

    "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of all men?  The Shadow knows!"
    Old radio shows are again playing on the air, capturing the ears and
    imaginations of a generation that has never heard of a cat's whisker
    tuner or a carbon arc transmitter!  Now, what could be better than
    listening to these great moments from the Golden Age of radio on an
    antique radio you've restored yourself?
    
    RADIO is a preliminary course on "How to service and restore antique
    radios."  Fixing up old radios can be a rewarding hobby, particularly as
    antique radios have become collectors items!  The quintessence of
    nostalgia, many of these old radios are lying around in attics and at
    junk shops -- waiting for someone to see past the dust and bring them
    back to life!
    
    This how-to booklet on disk reveals the simple test equipment you will
    need and guides you, step-by-step, through the process of checking and
    repairing each component of an antique radio to restore it to top-notch
    condition.  A vacuum tube guide is provided, as well as the RMA color
    code for power transformers, audio-frequency transformers,
    intermediate-frequency transformers, and speaker field coils.
    
    RADIATION EXPOSURE CALCULATOR calculates your approximate yearly
    radiation exposure from a variety of sources, including your computer
    monitor!  The radiation data used by this program was compiled from a
    recent study by the Department of Commerce.
