## Information about "UNO AND GAMES & YCAL/DCAL"

    This games package mixes a new computerized version of a classic card
    game with a hard disk menu for your other computer games.  This familiar
    card game -- called UNO -- centers on who can go out first by playing
    all cards dealt.  You play against a relentless computer.  Great for
    anyone who likes computer cards.
    
    The GAME menu offers you a quick, easy way to reach your most popular
    games.  You can edit the menu to allow access to any game on your hard
    disk.  This is not as fancy as other menu systems in the library but it
    does the job.
    
    Calendars are like police, there's never one around when you need one.
    Until now!  YCAL lets you print out a yearly calendar, for any year,
    from 1582 to 9999.  Just type in the year and YCAL creates a file with a
    bold heading for that year.  You only have to copy that file to your
    printer with a DOS command and you have a smart looking calendar that
    fits on standard letter-sized paper.
    
    Just want to check a date?  DCAL displays the any-three-month calendar
    on your screen.  If you don't specify a date, DCAL uses your DOS system
    date.  Use YCAL/DCAL and never waste any more time looking for a
    calendar!
