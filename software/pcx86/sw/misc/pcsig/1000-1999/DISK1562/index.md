## Information about "ADVERTISING RESPONSE MANAGER"

    Advertisers, there is an easy way to see if your advertising dollars
    are paying off. ADVERTISING RESPONSE MANAGER (ARM) lets you keep track
    of the response to all types of advertising and promotional campaigns.
    ARM can handle advertisements, news releases, product surveys,
    technical articles, reply cards, or anything else you use as
    promotional material. ARM gets you started with menus that prompt you
    for everything from product information to advertising costs. Once
    your advertising and promotional pieces are entered, another section of
    the program allows you, or your administrative support, to keep track
    of responses. You do not need to be a computer or advertising guru to
    effectively use ARM.
    
    You can look at how much you spent on advertising overall, or by
    publication, by product, by type of media, or by individual piece. You
    can look at responses based on the media name, issue, type,
    identification number, product advertised, last response date, or number
    of responses to date.
    
    One of the best things about ARM is that it allows you to easily plug
    your data files into any other spreadsheet or database program that
    uses dBase files. With ARM, you can finally see what you're getting
    for your advertising dollar.
