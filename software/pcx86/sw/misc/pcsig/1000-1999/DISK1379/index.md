## Information about "VMS VOCABULARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    Create customized learning games for your children or students to help
    them improve their vocabularies, sharpen their spelling and learn new
    subjects.  A variety of educational games can be created suitable to any
    age level from six year olds to adult and covering almost any topic.
    
    The EDITOR allows you to compile facts and word lists you want used in
    the five different games.
    
    WORD SEARCH makes printed word search puzzles and anagram puzzles.  TEST
    PRINTER makes printed match-the-word-to-its-definition puzzles.  A
    sample included is STATES which challenges students to match the states
    of the United States with their associated capitals, mottos, state
    flowers and state birds.  Similarly the program could be used to learn
    other subjects, such as: presidents/important acts; foreign vocabulary
    words/English words; metric units of measure/English units; dates in
    history/important events; famous writings/their authors, etc.
    
    The other three customizable games are played on the computer.  QUIZZER
    tests players on words and their definitions.  FORTUNE provides a
    ``Wheel of Fortune'' game format where players compete to identify a
    word by guessing the letters of its definition.  SPELLER quizzes
    students on the spelling of words and includes the games FLASH and
    ANAGRAMS.
