## Information about "SAGE - THE PAST LIFE TUTOR"

    THE SAGE'S APPRENTICE - THE PAST LIFE TUTOR should liven up your next
    party or social gathering! First it was New Age music, then New Age
    videos, and now we have New Age software! Actually, this is a very
    intriguing program which focuses on the controversial subject of past
    lives or reincarnation!
    
    Introductory screens take you through several guided visualization
    exercises and discuss the concept of past lives. If you wish to pursue
    a study of past lives, the program gives you four cultures to explore
    through visualization exercises: Ancient Egypt, Renaissance Europe,
    Ancient Greece, and Atlantis.
