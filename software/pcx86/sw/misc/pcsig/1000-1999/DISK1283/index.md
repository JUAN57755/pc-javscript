## Information about "BLACKJACK!"

    BLACKJACK! is a tour de force in beating the casino dealer, and might
    help you line your pockets with green.  Long overdue, it teaches you a
    basic blackjack strategy, adds an effective card counting system to it,
    and drills you on both the strategy and your counting ability.  You play
    against world famous casinos or customize the rules the dealer follows.
    It's fun, quickly played, and could fatten your wallet on your next trip
    to Nevada, New Jersey, or Monte Carlo.
    
    BLACKJACK! is a joy because you can alter the number of decks in the
    shoe and practice your count in the most difficult of circumstances.
    The rules on doubling down automatically change as you switch from
    single to multiple decks.  You can play head on or add up to three
    players to your table.  You watch your bank rise and sink with your luck
    and you can get instant advice on how to alter your betting strategy.
