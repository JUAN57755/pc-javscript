## Information about "PKPAK, PKUNPAK, AND PKSFX"

    PKPAK, PKUNPAK and PKSFX are a set of archiving utilities that allow you
    to compress your files into an archive file which takes up less disk
    space for storage and helps reduce the transmission time when sending
    files over the modem. PKPAK compresses multiple files into an archive
    file, PKUNPAK extracts some or all these files from the archive for
    normal program usage, and PKSFX creates self-extracting archive files.
    Archive files may be updated, listed to the screen, annotated with
    comments, printed, and password protected.
    
    Other features include: extract only the most recent files when the same
    named file already exists on disk, extract files to the printer in both
    ASCII and binary mode, an easier to read listing of files, and updating
    archives which are larger than half your floppy disk storage area.
