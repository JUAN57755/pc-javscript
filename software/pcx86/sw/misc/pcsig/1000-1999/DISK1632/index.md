## Information about "GRADING ASSISTANT"

    Here's some quality help for harried teachers.  GRADING ASSISTANT churns
    out student grades throughout the grading period with a minimum of
    effort and study.  The well crafted menus let computer-wise teachers
    skip most of the manual and plunge into program installation.  To aid in
    tracking, GRADING ASSISTANT produces a bonanza of student and class
    average reports.
    
    Teachers can use up to 12 grade categories such as work, homework,
    projects, tests and quizzes for each class.  Different weights can be
    assigned to each category, but categories and weights can be changed at
    any time.
    
    Compute both numeric and letter grade averages.  You define your own
    match of numeric grades to letter grades with pluses and minuses.  You
    can automatically drop the lowest score for each student in a class for
    a particular grade category.
    
    A thunderstorm of reports awaits the number conscious teacher.  You get
    current grade average reports for each student in each class. You can
    get student averages for up to 12 different categories of grades per
    class.  You also get the class grade distribution counts by letter
    grade.
    
    An interim grade report lets you produce a listing for each student
    whose average is below a cut-off numeric grade.  This helps the teacher
    notify both parent and child that things need changing.  The class
    roster is handy for taking attendance or manually recording select
    grades.  You get year-to-date grade average reports by student and by
    class and the overall average for each of the past grading periods of
    the school year.  Then you get an overall school year average for each
    student in each class.  You can compute a yearly class grade average at
    the end of the school year.
    
    A special subprogram lets a teacher display current grade averages or
    grade averages from previous grading periods as a simple bar graph.
    And, another included program file lets teachers maintain a file of each
    student's address and telephone number.
