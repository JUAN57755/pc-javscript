## Information about "HELP!/POP-HELP"

    Finally, the help that we've all been looking for!  HELP!! And POP-
    HELP are a combined on-line reference manual to DOS that comes when
    it's called and is always there when you need it. Both HELP!! And POP-
    HELP are DOS utilities with a complete listing of DOS commands through
    DOS version 3.3. HELP!! Is available at the DOS command line. POP-HELP
    is memory-resident, so it is available anywhere you are. This is the
    program that every husband should give his wife (and vice versa)
    unless,
    of course, you wish to appear incredibly knowledgeable.
    
    Both HELP!! And POP-HELP are easy to use. POP-HELP's command keys can
    be set so that they will not conflict with your program commands. There
    are very clear instructions to allow you to add extra
