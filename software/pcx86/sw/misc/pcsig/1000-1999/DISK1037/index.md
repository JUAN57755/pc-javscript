## Information about "PC-KWICK AND OTHER UTILITIES"

    Speed up disk-intensive programs with memory cache.  Great for programs
    like WordStar that use overlay files.  Redundant disk accesses are
    eliminated by storing frequently-read data in RAM memory.  This RAM can
    be accessed instantaneously, unlike mechanical drives.  The concept is
    similar to a RAM disk; however, you can gain more performance with less
    RAM requirements because PC-KWICK is smart enough to store only
    repeatedly-accessed code in memory.
    
    PC-KWICK automatically allocates memory above 360K that is not used by
    DOS or other memory-resident programs.  The program is designed for DOS
    2.0 through 3.3.
    
    RECONFIG is a handy utility for quickly reconfiguring your AUTOEXEC.BAT
    and CONFIG.SYS files.  Multiple AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files can be
    stored by RECONFIG and accessed by a batch file that automatically
    switches files for alternative computer set-ups.  The utility can also
    reboot your computer.
    
    COMPRESS is a data compression routine for text files.  It compresses
    one file at a time, and works under a variety of operating systems
    including MS DOS, VMS and even various versions of UNIX.  C source code
    is provided.
    
    No more memorizing of DOS commands, syntax or keyboard codes.
    EDICOM-12 converts DOS to a menu driven system that's easy to use and
    more productive. Typing commands are replaced by moving the cursor and
    pressing Enter.
