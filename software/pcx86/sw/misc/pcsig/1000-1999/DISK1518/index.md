## Information about "PC-ARENA OTHELLO AND CHESS"

    Want to play chess against a Russian in the Soviet Union?  Or how about
    a game of Othello against an Italian in Nice?  Better yet, how would you
    like to do it without even leaving home?
    
    PC-ARENA OTHELLO and PC-ARENA CHESS let you go up against fellow gamers
    with a PC and a modem anywhere in the world -- limited only by your
    credit with the phone company!
    
    PC-ARENA Chess play is governed by the International Chess
    Federation Laws of Chess. The gaming system validates all moves
    according to the rules of chess, supports castling, piece promotion,
    and en passant capture.
    
    Othello, invented around 1888 and popularized in the local pubs, is
    played on a draughtsboard using sixty-four stone or wooden pieces. PC-
    ARENA Othello, developed in 1985 and popularized on electronic bulletin
    board systems and through user group libraries, is played on a PC
    equipped with a modem.
    
    Let the games begin!
