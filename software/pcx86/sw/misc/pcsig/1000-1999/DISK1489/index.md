## Information about "SLIMMER"

    SLIMMER is a computerized diet program that makes calorie-counting
    easier than ever before.
    
    SLIMMER will calculate your ideal weight and proper caloric intake and
    provide you with an extensive menu of recommended foods and their
    calorie values.  Food lists can be created for each day of the week and
    printed for reference.  SLIMMER also provides information on the
    calories consumed by various forms of exercise.  The SLIMMER program is
    menu driven so it's easy to use, and the food database can be expanded
    for those with exotic tastes.
