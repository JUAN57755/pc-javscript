## Information about "ARGAFIND, ARGAMENU, AND ARGACOPY"

    Three related programs to simplify life on the hard drive!
    
    ARGA-FIND is welcome relief for hard disk owners who forget in which
    directory, or sub-sub-subdirectory they left a needed file! A misplaced
    file lost somewhere on a 20 MB hard disk is the modern day "needle in a
    haystack"! Fortunately, this program does the searching for you and
    displays the located filename, length, date, time, and path to get to
    it. Since "wild-cards" are permitted, the full filename need not be
    known. This version can search a maximum of 512 directories, with 512
    files per directory.
    
    ARGA-MENU makes it easy for you to bring order to your countless files
    and programs on your hard disk by creating point-and-shoot menus. This
    means you can automatically call up a program on any drive or directory,
    without needing to know where it's located or defining its DOS path --
    all with one key-stroke. When you exit one of these files or programs,
    you are automatically returned to the menu. Menus are a great way of
    limiting other users to specific programs or files in your system where
    they can do no harm!
    
    ARGA-MENU can hold up to 90 menu selections, organized as nine pages
    with 10 entries on each page. Menus in different directories can be
    "chained" to each other for greater flexibility. The program guides
    you through installation and updating, with all menu entries made from
    the menu, without using a text editor or wordprocessor.
    
    ARGA-COPY is a DOS shell that lets you do the most common DOS operations
    (copy, delete, etc.) with the direction cursor keys or a mouse. When
    performing housekeeping chores on a hard disk, or even floppies -- such
    as erasing no longer needed files, moving files from one directory to
    another, etc. -- you will quickly appreciate not having to continuously
    type in DOS commands and path names! A click or keystroke selects any
    of eight of the most useful DOS commands, and three file sort functions.
