## Information about "MULTI-PRINT"

    Looking for a better alternative to the DOS PRINT program?  Something
    that will give you more control over your printing?  MULTI-PRINT accepts
    several different parameters for such added features as printing
    multiple copies of a document, left margin adjustment, page length, page
    width, and the ability to add page numbers and time stamps to the
    printout.  Like PRINT.COM which comes on your DOS disk, this program has
    a print queue for multiple files, but MULTI-PRINT can also work in batch
    mode accepting a list of documents (with command options) from a file.
    MULTI-PRINT prints a file in interactive mode constantly displaying what
    is being printed, the files in the print queue, and a helpful estimation
    of print time.
    
    The added control and flexibilty that come with MULTI-PRINT make it a
    necessary part of any user's utility library.
