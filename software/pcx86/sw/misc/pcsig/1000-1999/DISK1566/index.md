## Information about "NAMES & DATES (ALSO 1568)"

    Do you ever find yourself switching back and forth between
    your address manager and your calendar program?  Why not integrate both
    programs into one tidy application.  NAMES AND DATES keeps
    track of addresses and dates, and allows you to print mailing
    labels, envelopes, address books, and rolodex cards as well as wall
    calendars, and full page reports -- all from the same print menu.  With
    this one program you can set up a meeting, then generate a mailing label
    for a confirmation letter.
    
    The address records have extra large entry fields for a person's title,
    first name, last name or business name, address, two phone numbers,
    category, salutation, and eight lines of notes.  Data may be
    imported or exported from the program, and mail merge files can be
    created for letters.
    
    NAMES AND DATES also has a date reminder system, where you may
    enter the month, day and year of important events or appointments.  A
    monthly calendar will flash the important days that you have
    entered, or you can print these dates on a wall type calendar.
    Printing can be done on either conventional or laser printers.
    Complete documentation is included on the disk, as well as context
    sensitive help screens.
    
    NAMES AND DATES can handle an unlimited number of records.
