## Information about "3GRAPH"

    You can literally add an extra dimension to your graphics plotting with
    3GRAPH.  This abbreviated shareware version of 3GRAPH lets you plot
    up to 10 data points in a three-dimensional representation through use
    of a spreadsheet-structured interface.
    
    3GRAPH is straightforward in operation, and the accompanying
    documentation is adequate and understandable.  You can import files from
    your ASCII editor or Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.1.  Serious users will
    undoubtedly prefer the commercial version for its expanded 625 data
    point plotting capabilities.
    
    Special note:  the program will work on a CGA system, but only to view
    the graphics on the screen, not print them.
    File Descriptions:
    
    3GRAPH   EXE  Main program file.
