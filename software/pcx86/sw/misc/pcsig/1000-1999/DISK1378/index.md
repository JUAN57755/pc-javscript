## Information about "VISION FREE SOFTWARE"

    VISION is a collection of six mathematical programs which will help ease
    the pain of certain sequential computations:
    
    ~ DTF converts a real number into a series of fractions, each more
    accurate than the preceding one until the error is less than one part
    per ten million.
    
    ~ FACT calculates the factorial for any input number and FFFF defines
    all prime factors and powers of a given factorial.
    
    ~ GCD computes the greatest common divisor for any two integers.
    
    ~ REDUCE defines a fraction as a product of prime factors and its real
    number equivalent.
    
    ~ FACTOR determines the prime factors of a given number or declares that
    number to be prime.
    
    ~ TEMPCONV converts temperatures between units Kelvin, centigrade,
    Fahrenheit, and Rankine.
    
    All of these programs can be installed and used with or without a math
    coprocessor.  Documentation is included on disk.
