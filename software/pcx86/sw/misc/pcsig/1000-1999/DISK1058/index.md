## Information about "EXPRESSGRAPH"

    EXPRESSGRAPH is an easy-to-use business graphics program.  Numbers can
    be analyzed much more easily and quickly when they are displayed in
    graphic form.  It lets you display numbers in a variety of graphic
    formats.  Then you can choose the display you like best, and print your
    graph.
    
    Here are some examples of how people use EXPRESSGRAPH:
    
    ~ Graphing sales dollars and gross profit on a weekly basis
    
    ~ Displaying financial data graphically
    
    ~ Analyzing budgets and expenses with a pie chart
    
    ~ Spotting trends amid a "sea of numbers"
    
    ~ Providing summarized data in graphic form to accompany financial
    statements, for quick analysis and trend spotting
    
    The data for the graph can be imported from one of three formats,
    including DIF, or entered from within EXPRESSGRAPH.  Save the data on
    disk and reload later for further changes or review.  Graphs created
    with EXPRESSGRAPH can be displayed in one of 10 graphic formats (pie,
    line, bar, etc.), altered in various ways, and printed.
