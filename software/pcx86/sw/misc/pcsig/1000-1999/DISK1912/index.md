## Information about "TV/VOAPUK AND CRAZYDOS"

    VOLAPUK is a combination practical joke and look-busy program.  Start
    the mock debugger and your memory is seemingly reconfigured, your hard
    disk is diagnosed, and all errors are cleared from existence -- in
    reality the screen messages are the only things that are changing.
    
    TV simulates the late-night movie "War of the Ants" (that's where the
    screen "fuzzes out" after the national anthem).  Then, when you press a
    key, the loudspeaker is silenced and the random pattern turns into a
    beautiful person with the message "Dear User, I Love You."  In a few
    seconds the dreamgirl/dreamboy vanishes, the "War of the Ants"
    continues.  Another keystroke takes you back to DOS.  The programs are
    self-testing against viruses for security.
    
    A wisecrack response for every DOS command, for your own entertainment
    or a practical joke.  CRAZYDOS is a temporary "replacement" for DOS with
    some interesting responses to commands.  There are some alarming looking
    "error messages," but don't worry, there are no aliens, molasses, or
    problems reading drive Q:.  All "system crashes," "Chinese keyboards,"
    etc., are imaginary and temporary, and can be ended by a keypress in
    some cases, or ENTER in others.  To exit CRAZYDOS you must tell your
    computer "I love you."
