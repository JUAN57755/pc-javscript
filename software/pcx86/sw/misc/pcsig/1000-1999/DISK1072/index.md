## Information about "DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND CALCULUS"

    These programs visualize and solve high-level mathematical equations,
    conveniently graphing them for you on an EGA monitor.  Great for
    students, scientists, or anyone who just enjoys math.
    
    The DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION program can solve a variety of both ordinary
    and partial differential equations.  You can also integrate factors of
    an equation, and create a graph of power series solutions.
    
    Use the CALCULUS program to find the derivatives of an expression in x
    and/or y. Other features include graphing functions of y=f(x), graphing
    first and second derivatives, solving and graphing parametric
    equations,
    finding the integral of simple functions, and finding the surface
    contour of a function z=f(x,y).  An MS-Windows version is available for
    registered users.
