## Information about "EDNA'S COOK BOOK"

    EDNA'S COOKBOOK is a program that will store and organize all your
    recipes and even provides password protection to keep your guarded
    family recipes secret from prying eyes.
    
    Now, you no longer have to deal with disorganized slips of paper and
    clippings thrown together in a drawer or box, only to be frustrated when
    you can't find that particular recipe. EDNA'S COOKBOOK is a program for
    collecting, filing, sorting, finding and printing recipes. Essentially,
    it is the equivalent of the cookbook in which you now keep all your
    recipes, except that it is electronic. The program may also be used in
    the preparation of cookbooks for publication.
    
    The screen is divided into an ingredients section and a directions
    section, making it simple to enter your recipes along with a selected
    category (such as soups), a subcategory (lentil), a name (Mama's Hearty
    Soup), and a source where the recipe was obtained (my mom). Categories
    and subcategories can be changed to suit your own preferences. Once
    entered, recipes may be listed or printed individually, by category,
    subcategory, or all at once.
    
    EDNA'S COOKBOOK automatically sorts and arranges your recipes for you
    alphabetically by category, then by subcategory, and then by recipe
    name -- making it easy to find things. You can also encrypt any recipe
    you wish with a password, so that certain recipes may be kept private.
