## Information about "LEARN TO GUESS"

    LEARN TO GUESS is a set of four games that can help your child,
    grades 1-12, to learn basic arithmetic and develop problem-solving
    strategies. Each of the games is complete in itself. When used in
    sequence, skills already learned are honed and reinforced.
    
    In GUESSME, for one to four players, students in grades 1-8 develop
    their problem-solving strategies by trying to guess the computer's
    secret number. There are eight levels of difficulty which sustain the
    challenge for most players. Other concepts used in the remaining
    programs are introduced here.
    
    ROMAN GUESSME is identical to GUESSME, except the numbers used are
    displayed as, and must be entered as, Roman numerals. Grades 5-12.
    
    At first glance, NEAREST (a game for two to four players) seems to be a
    simple number-guessing game, but it requires sharper thinking than is at
    first apparent. Appropriate for grades 2-8.
    
    SUPERGUESS, for two to four players, challenges students in grades 3-12
    to exercise their knowledge of prime numbers, composite numbers,
    factors, multiples, sums, differences, and products as they compete
    against one another in a race across the computer's screen.
