## Information about "FONE: RESIDENTAL"

    If you are a home computer user looking for a way to bring long
    distance
    telephone bills under control, FONE RESIDENTIAL can help you reduce and
    track telecommunications costs.  FONE is a mature telephone call
    pricing database program for point-to-point, voice, FAX, E-mail, and BBS
    calls.
    
    FONE will display the approximate prices for national interstate long
    distance calls.  Several major telecommunication vendors are
    represented (AT&T, ITT, MCI, US SPRINT, etc.), including many
    services for each vendor.  For each query, FONE(tm) will display the
    point of origination, time, point of destination (over 1200 cities are
    in the national database), approximate call BEFORE IT IS PLACED, the
    vendor ID, effective date of the rates, call billing periods, and
    applicable times for the lowest rates.
    
    At the press of a button, FONE(tm) will track the price of an ongoing
    call in real time.  Several user options, using F-keys, are available,
    including adjustment of sample call times, volume discount calculation,
    the ability to temporarily exit to DOS while the timer is running, plus
    many other features.  A personal directory with notepad, for tracking
    contacts, is provided, and the user can get a printed report for each
    call displayed on the rate screen.
    
    FONE is very easy to use, features hot menus, and an extensive help
    facility.
