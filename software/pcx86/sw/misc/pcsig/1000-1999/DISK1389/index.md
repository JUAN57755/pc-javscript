## Information about "FALL THRU"

    You and up to two other players stand only half a chance of making it
    home alive in this text adventure, called FALLTHRU!
    
    You don't know how you got to this strange place, but you quickly
    discover that Faland is very large, comprising millions of square miles
    (all visitable) of farms, rangeland, forests, deserts, mountains, etc.
    Much of it is inhabited by dangerous wild animals, renegades,
    warriors, and demons.
    
    You and your fellow players must find your way through the trackless
    wilderness, while quickly learning to recognize friend and foe, earning
    a living, and defending yourself by fist and weapon.  And along the way
    you must gather information and solve various riddles and puzzles by
    talking to shop keepers, strangers, warriors, inn keepers, etc., and by
    exploring the many settlements, dark and treacherous caverns,
    catacombs, mines, castles and ruins scattered throughout this vast
    territory.
    
    FALLTHRU recognizes several hundred words by which you can set your
    course, pick up objects, buy and sell things, fight, hunt, shoot, and
    speak to the odd characters you and your companions will meet as you try
    to go home!  Age level: 12 to adult.
