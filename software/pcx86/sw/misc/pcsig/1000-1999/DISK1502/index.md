## Information about "XACT SERIES CALCULATORS"

    XACT brings you a trio of programs emulating three top Hewlett Packard
    hand held calculators -- the HP-11C Scientific Calculator, the HP-12C
    Financial Calculator, and the HP-16C Programmer's Calculator.
    
    All three programs have approximately 70 functions keys laid out in the
    standard HP format. The prefix key usage is the same on the
    computer and the calculator.
    
    "When a program performs flawlessly, it makes writing a review hard.
    Such is the case with XACT-16C."-- Jacques Benavente, PCM Magazine,
    August 1988.
    
    "PC-12C's (an OEM version of XACT-12C) emulation of the HP-12C is
    exact....  Popular's PC-12C gets my vote." Jim Seymour, "The Best of
    the Best Utilities," PC Magazine, June 1987.
    
    "XACT-16C...  It has power to burn." Johnathan Matzkin, PC
    Magazine, May 29, 1988.
    
    "It's (XACT-11C) just like my HP-11C. I use it all the time and keep it
    on my laptop computer when travelling." Bill Treneer, 1776 Corporation.
