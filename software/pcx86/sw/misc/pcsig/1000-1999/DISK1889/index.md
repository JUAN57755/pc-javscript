## Information about "BESTGUES"

    BESTGUES is a task planning tool intended to complement the increasingly
    popular scheduling programs which have proliferated in recent years.
    BESTGUES is based on the PERT time estimating technique (as opposed to
    the PERT task charting technique found in many planning packages),
    helping you to conveniently estimate how much time to assign to each
    scheduled event.
    
    PERT time estimating using BESTGUES is a statistically based approach.
    You break each major schedule item into subtasks (up to 15) and assign a
    minimum, typical and maximum time estimate for each.  On your command,
    BESTGUES then calculates probability data for your entries.  This data
    helps you to estimate the task duration with a statistically determined
    confidence of success.
    
    BESTGUES has been designed specifically to make the PERT estimating
    process easy to use. The menu prompts virtually eliminate the need for a
    manual or chart of commands.  BESTGUES uses a simple function key based
    menu system and provides several data samples to show just how simple
    the program is to use.  Whether you are estimating labor costs, lead
    times or have to estimate the duration of an event, with BESTGUES you
    can make an intelligent, prudent guess.
