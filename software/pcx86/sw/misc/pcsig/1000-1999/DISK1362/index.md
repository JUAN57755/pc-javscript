## Information about "THE PASSING PASSAGES AND GS-TESTIT"

    Trying for your wings? GS-TESTIT will give you practice to pass the
    Private Pilots' written examination administered by the FAA.
    
    Using actual FAA questions, this quiz program lets you select from
    several subject categories, including: the physical aircraft,
    navigation, airports and air traffic control, FAA regulations, the
    weather, and the environmental effects of aircraft. GS-TESTIT then
    selects 40 multiple choice questions to quiz you on, tells you instantly
    which questions you may have answered incorrectly, lets you review the
    question and try again.
    
    Included, also, is PASSING PASSAGES, an educational game where you are
    lost in a maze and confronted by FAA examiners who ask you test
    questions which you must answer correctly in order to move on! To
    survive, you must also find cash, food, and places to sleep. The right
    side of the screen shows a graphic representation of the hallways and
    doors, while the left side of the screen shows a map which is made as
    you explore the maze. May also be played without the questions.
