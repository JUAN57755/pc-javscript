## Information about "A_CURSE AND MORE"

    Cursed PC!  More than an epithet, A_CURSE is a practical joke program
    that causes the victim's computer to start spouting macabre curses,
    such as, "May a one-eyed pigeon nest in your hard drive!"  "May
    raunchy pitbulls kidnap your spreadsheet!"
    
    A_CURSE displays up to ten random curses on your chosen one's
    screen.  Each one is different (with millions of possible
    combinations) and they vary from the absurd to the disgusting.
    What a way to start the day!
    
    This delightful Othello-like game was created as a college class
    project.  Well designed and speedy, it was written in Turbo Pascal.
    Fortunately, the students made the source code available as part of the
    package for those interested in programming.  With four skill levels,
    the game permits up to four players.  Othello devotees will find the
    computer is generally a mite smarter than expected when it comes to
    outflanking their squares.  The game works well on both color and
    monochrome displays.
    
    ASTEROID FIELD BATTLE is a challenging battle against the dreaded
    Electronians within the confines of a computer screen.
    
    Your ship is trapped inside an electro-barrier and the Electronians are
    hunting you down.  Your sole defenses are a limited force field, a short
    range laser, and several asteroids also trapped in the barrier which can
    be used to pick off the enemy ships.
    
    This game can be played with or without a joystick.  There are five
    levels of play, but the speed is CPU clock dependent so faster hardware
    may need to be reset to play.  Beware!  As with any zap'em game, this
    one is highly addictive.
