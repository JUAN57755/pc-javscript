## Information about "ANYANGLE"

    Pythagoras would be proud!  But if you don't know who Pythagoras is, you
    probably don't need this program.  Ancient Greeks notwithstanding, most
    people do not appreciate the mathematical beauty underlying the simple
    triangle.  If you yearn to become enlightened, though, this is the place
    to start!
    
    ANYANGLE takes the drudgery out of capitalizing on the mathematical
    elegance of the triangle.  If you provide a minimum amount of data about
    a triangle, this program computes the rest, solving for unknown angles
    or side lengths given what you have available.
    
    Even if you're not a surveyor or trigonometry buff, you could use this
    program to calculate the height of the trees in your yard, plan your
    next woodworking project more rationally, or even landscape in the Greek
    tradition (Thomas Jefferson did, the hard way!).
    
    Triangle aficionados will appreciate the analysis section of the
    program
    which provides such esoterica as area, perimeter, altitude, coordinates
    of vertices, and data about the inscribed circle and circumcircle.
