## Information about "SUPER LOTTO-MASTER"

    Anyone who believes no lottery system is truly random will find a
    friend in SUPER LOTTO-MASTER.
    
    Not a random-number generator, but rather a historically weighted
    system, this program lets you enter past winning numbers for whatever
    lottery you are tracking.  It then computes the odds of the numbers
    being picked again.  SUPER LOTTO handles three, four, five, six and
    seven-number games and prints its choices in a list that ranks best to
    worst.  You can also add in your own lucky number with the computer's --
    to hedge your bet.  The program is menu-driven and requires no
    mathematical or computer skills to operate.  As soon as you've entered
    at least 10 numbers, the program is ready to make predictions for you.
