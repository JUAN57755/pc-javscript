## Information about "INSTANT ACCESS MENU SYSTEM"

    INSTANT ACCESS MENU SYSTEM allows you to organize your software from one
    central program.  Menu-driven and colorful, it can help you get the most
    out of your computer with the least amount of hassle.
    
    Access any program you have on your disk from a menu.  A one-letter
    selection will move you through the wilds of DOS paths, find your
    selection and start it.  When you are done, it returns you to the
    control menu.  A certain degree of experience with DOS will help you to
    configure the menus when you first set up the system, and provide you
    with the incentive to set up the system.
    
    Included on the main menu with the system is a notepad, a text editor, a
    DOS shell, a time log and a screen dimmer.  INSTANT ACCESS can be
    included in your AUTOEXEC file, and provision has been made to assign
    passwords to each program if you need to control access to specific
    software.
