## Information about "ANARKEY"

    Tired of having to retype the DOS command when you make a spelling
    error?  Reduce the number of keystrokes you make when entering DOS
    commands by using ANARKEY.
    
    ANARKEY is a commmand-line editor that will significantly reduce the
    keystrokes you make when entering DOS commands.  ANARKEY provides one of
    the most powerful, compact, and flexible command-line environments
    available on a DOS machine.
    
    ANARKEY is a memory resident program that intercepts your DOS commands.
    When you make a typing error, you can move the cursor backwards, without
    erasing characters, and make the correction.   You can't do this with
    DOS.  The shape of the cursor also changes to indicate overwrite or
    insert mode.  ANARKEY will save all the commands you enter so that you
    can recall them for later use.  This saves you from having to reenter
    commands that are used repeatedly.  Simply press the F4 key until the
    command you want appears and then press enter.
    
    ANARKEY also provides improved program and directory search functions,
    and the ability to control environment variables.  It will also run in
    expanded memory so that it requires less than 1K of DOS memory space.
