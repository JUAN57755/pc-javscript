## Information about "SEEDMASTER 1 OF 10 (1591-1600)"

    SEEDMASTER allows you to find specific words and phrases in the
    King James Bible (included). Unlike traditional concordances
    (which provide verse references for a single word), SeedMaster can
    search for combinations of words with options to test for specific word
    order and case sensitivity. Logic searches (AND, OR, XOR, and NOT) are
    also available.
    
    For Bible study, SeedMaster can display and scroll up to three Bible
    text windows side by side. The text can be scrolled one verse at a
    time, or the user can jump directly to a specific verse locations.
    Selected Bible verses can be printed or saved to a disk file. All Bible
    books can be selected from a menu (you don't have to remember book
    abbreviations).
    
    Additional features include:
    
    ~ Commentary function to enter and recall your comments verse by verse
    
    ~ Pop-up notepad to develop lessons within the program
    
    ~ Copy and paste text
    
    ~ Output can be viewed or sent to disk or printer
