## Information about "NIRVANA"

    When you enter this world of Wimsey, an incredible interactive fantasy
    awaits you.  You will explore uncharted territory, solve ingenious
    puzzles, and talk to fascinating and sometimes deadly characters.  Your
    quest: Destroy the Ice Maiden, Nirvana, and end the monthly
    disappearance of young men from the village.
    
    Nirvana can only be destroyed by ringing a crystal bell.  You must find
    the bell, enter her dark castle and destroy her.  Otherwise, a fate
    worse than death awaits you.  Here is a good thinking person's game with
    a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words you can use when speaking to the
    characters you meet.
    
    This program can also be used as a door on some bulletin board services.
    Check your BBS software to see if it has this capability.
