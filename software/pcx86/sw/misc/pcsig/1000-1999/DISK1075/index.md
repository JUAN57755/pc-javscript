## Information about "TIME TRAVELER & FACING THE EMPIRE"

    You begin this text adventure in the Stanford University lecture hall in
    the year 2285.  First, you must find the fabled Darnoc Time Machine.
    Then hurry back to the past to find the allaw allaw plant needed to save
    all civilization.  Remember, you must be both smart and alert.  Travel
    to the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.  Visit revolutionary Philadelphia,
    the wild west, Sherwood Forest, the Egyptian pyramids, and an a
    prehistoric jungle. If you overcome the brontosaurus and other threats,
    you might save mankind.  Remember that you alone have the burden of
    saving the world, one mistake and life on Earth as we know it will cease
    to exist.
    
    If you like strategic war gaming, then FACING THE EMPIRE might be right
    up your intergalactic alley!  Not an arcade game designed around speed,
    flashy graphics and high-speed joystick jockeying, FACING THE EMPIRE is
    more like a strategic board game -- oriented toward reasoning, planning
    and logistics.
    
    As a member of the Lyran Stellar Federation, you must prepare your
    fleets and probes for deployment and battle.  Then you must seek out the
    seven randomly-placed Morte stars hidden in the sixty-four stars of the
    Lyran periphery.  You can accumulate points through destruction of Morte
    ship groups, bases, and their invasion headquarters.  All this must be
    accomplished while they're trying to get you first!
