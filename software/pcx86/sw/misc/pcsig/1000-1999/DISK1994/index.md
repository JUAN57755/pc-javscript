## Information about "DOS-EZ, MAKESYS AND LISTBACK"

    DOS-EZ is a package of utilities to help make using a PC a little
    easier.  Included are some extensions of existing functions, as well as
    some routines that DOS forgot.
    
    ~ NOW -- Displays both current date and time at once.
    
    ~ SOUND -- Makes the speaker in your PC sing or beep.
    
    ~ VIEW -- A full screen browsing program to view a specific file.
    Better than the TYPE command, contents won't scroll off the screen.
    
    ~ XDIR -- XDIR provides more functions than "DIR *.* | SORT". XDIR can
    search files before/after/within certain dates. XDIR also sorts the
    screen output.
    
    ~ DTREE -- Displays the tree structure of specific pathnames or disks.
    
    ~ XDEL -- Deletes all files and files in sub-directories. In addition,
    XDEL try to remove all sub-directories if it is possible.
    
    ~ RNDIR -- Renames a directory.
    
    ~ MVFILES -- Moves files from one directory to another directory.
    Wildcard and "?" can be used in files' name which MS-DOS lacks.
    
    ~ FDATE -- Change the date and time of specific files.
    
    ~ SWAPF -- Swap file or sub-directory without using "copy" and "delete."
    
    ~ CRYPT -- A DES algorithm to encrypt/decrypt your files.
    
    ~ WIPEOUT -- Writes zero to a file(s) and deletes it, completely erasing
    the contents of the file.
    
    ~ XFIND -- Search files for a keyword which may contain wildcard "*" and
    "?". Using Kunth-Morris-Pratt non-backtracking pattern searching
    algorithm.
    
    ~ FGREP -- Search files for multiple keywords. Using Aho-Corasick
    non-backtracking pattern searching algorithm.
    
    ~ GREP -- A superset of grep, fgrep, egrep. Support OR "|" operator and
    all regular expression operators.
    
    ~ FINDF -- Find one or more than one files in the specific disk.
    
    Still not sure why your CONFIG.SYS file is so vital, or not sure exactly
    how to make or change the one that's on your system?  MAKESYS finally
    explains what your CONFIG.SYS file does and helps you build one.  This
    program gives the non-technical user the power of the professionals.  It
    may also be a time saver for those who often find themselves editing a
    CONFIG.SYS file with a cumbersome editor.
    
    LISTBACK is a hard disk utility that lists all the files and directories
    stored on a backup disk that was created using the DOS 3.3 BACKUP
    command. LSTBACK2 will do the same for backup disks created using DOS
    2.0 to 3.2. If you do not know the backup disk number, LISTBACK
    displays it. If the backup disk is not the last one, LISTBACK will
    prompt you to insert the next disk. For each file listed you may
    optionally have the program display the full path specification the file
    was copied from.
