## Information about "MAST MAIL"

    MAST MAIL's focus is on making the interaction between user
    and computer smooth and simple, yet it is an advanced and versatile
    mailing list manager.  The commands for elementary tasks essential to a
    mailing list, such as adding, editing, finding, and deleting data, are
    direct and straightforward.  More powerful features
    include an unlimited comment area for each record, user-definable group
    and company number fields, as well as prefix, suffix, and
    salutation fields.  There is even an undelete function.
    
    Clear menus list and describe the command options on the screen and
    point to the on-line manual, which is just one keystroke away.
    MAST MAIL also provides command level functionality for other
    essential tasks such as reports, labels, envelopes, Rolodex cards,
    merging, exporting, and importing.
    
    MAST MAIL works well as a contact, lead, or direct mail program for
    salespersons.  With MAST MAIL's comment field you can store and
    track pertinent information on each of your clients.  A complex
    record selection feature makes MAST MAIL a productive tool for
    anyone who needs to phone, write letters, or send memorandums to
    selected people in the database.  You can also create multiple
    lists that are separate from one another.
    
    MAST MAIL is also an automated on-line Rolodex card system.  Names,
    addresses and phone numbers can be accessed in a fraction of the
    time of conventional Rolodex cards.  MAST MAIL can even speed dial your
    phone with only the touch of two keys.
    
    Data files are fully compatible with dBase III/III+ data files,
    making it possible to use your MAST MAIL data with any other
    database program that makes use of this file structure.  For mail
    merge, the secondary merge format of WordPerfect is supported, as well
    as two merge formats for PC-Write.
