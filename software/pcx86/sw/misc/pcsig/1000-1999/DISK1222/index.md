## Information about "PHAMPHLET"

    PAMPHLET is a printing utility for HP LaserJets that creates 5-1/2" x
    8-1/2" mini-booklets or pamphlets.
    
    PAMPHLET divides any ASCII file into mini-pages, and then prints them in
    landscape (sideways) mode, two-up on a single sheet.  A second pass
    through the printer to print the opposite side and -- VOILA!  You have a
    mini book.  Page arrangement is automatically determined by the program
    so the resultant sheets are in correct order.  Just fold down the middle
    and staple to form useful little pamphlets, booklets, or documentation
    manuals.  PAMPHLET is also great for parents wanting to create
    personalized story books for their children.
    
    Users can select from any of 25 resident fonts, upload additional soft
    fonts, place page breaks, automatically number pages, underline, and
    more.  There is even a built-in editor, and a configuration for using
    the program with European metric A4 paper size.
