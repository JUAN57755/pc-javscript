## Information about "FLASHPAC C LIBRARY 1 OF 2 (2306 ALSO)"

    Add blinding speed and style to your C programs with the FLASHPAC C
    LIBRARY.  Your programs will run faster and look better than anything
    you can buy.
    
    The FLASHPAC C LIBRARY provides C programmers with low level routines
    that access the video display, keyboard, printer, disk, and mouse
    devices.  These routines are not intended to replace the standard
    features of C.  They were created to add to and extend the C
    programming environment for MS-DOS and PC-DOS operating systems.  In
    keeping with good programming practice, global variables within the
    Library have been kept to a minimum.  All the functions in the Library
    are written in assembly language, for speed, using the Pascal
    parameter passing conventions.
    
    The FLASHPAC C LIBRARY contains routines for DISK -- many DOS
    functions that use byte STRAMS when accessing the disk files; VIDEO --
    direct access for saving and restoring the screen, framing windows,
    cursor control, etc.; MOUSE -- basic support plus an event handler;
    BIOS print functions; and both DOS and BIOS keyboard functions.
