## Information about "XYPLOT"

    XYPLOT provides you with a precise graph of your data for better
    visualizing mathematical, scientific, engineering, or business
    information.
    
    This versatile program displays and prints fully calibrated XY graphs of
    up to 1500 plotted points drawn from equations, individually inputted
    data, or imported "fixed length record" data files common to most
    spreadsheets and databases.  X versus Y plots can be produced in a
    variety of line textures.  X and Y axes may be linear or logarithmic.
    The aspect ratio of the graphs may be selected as 1.5 or 1. This
    permits complex data such as a sine versus a cosine to be displayed as a
    circle rather than an ellipse.  Display resolution can be 640 x 350
    pixels (EGA) or 640 x 200 pixels (CGA).  Mouse compatible, but not
    required.
    
    Program Limitations:  HP Laser printing, curve approximations, and bar
    graphs only available in registered version.
