## Information about "STARBOOKS"

    STARBOOKS generates purchase orders, maintains stock levels based on
    sales rates, tracks and automatically updates your inventory, invoices
    and bills your customers and tracks their accounts, keeps tabs on
    backorders, and tracks sales trends and profits on an item-by-item
    basis. It's a big, smart comprehensive program -- and yet is
    surprisingly simple to run.
    
    STARBOOKS does a lot more than similar programs costing over a thousand
    dollars. Set your proper inventory levels and STARBOOKS, through
    computer generated SKU numbers, watches sales to make sure you order
    soon enough, never forgetting to include backorders. It generates
    purchase orders by supplier and can automatically update stock levels.
    It prints out stock lists for inventories and lets you identify your
    shrinkage.
    
    The accounts receivable menu lets you generate invoices and statements
    which list past due invoices. Posting payments takes seconds. While the
    program does not age accounts, it generates a customer list with
    account statuses. It watches backorders and lets you split payments
    among invoices. If a customer phones in a query, you can bring up the
    account in seconds. Almost unique to the program is its ability to
    generate long invoices with hundreds of items printed on it.
    
    Read the documentation carefully. This program has its own way of doing
    things and isn't very forgiving of experimental key pressing.
