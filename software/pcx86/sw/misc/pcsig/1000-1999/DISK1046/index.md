## Information about "DR-EDIT"

    program editing is like wordprocessing.  DR-EDIT emulates many common
    wordprocessor and editor features and is recommended for computer users
    with at least a moderate technical knowledge of small computers and
    their programming.  DR-EDIT creates or edits ASCII files and offers
    ``horizontal scrolling'' to extend the screen's usable width from 80
    characters to 32K.  It has an overall length limit of 9,999 lines (this
    version is limited to 200 lines), the ability to concurrently edit two
    files, and a macro capability to expedite routine or repeated
    manipulations.  A special algorithm is used that makes DR-EDIT
    especially useful with artificial intelligence languages such as LISP,
    PROLOG, and C.
