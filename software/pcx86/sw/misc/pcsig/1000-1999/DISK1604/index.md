## Information about "TOMMY'S GORILLA BALLS/TOMMY'S METEORS"

    TOMMY'S GORILLA BALLS is a quick game in which you must dodge "gorilla
    balls" that roll out onto the screen from the four corners of the game
    table.  The game ends when you are rolled over by a gorilla ball, and
    you are given a score based upon the amount of time that you stayed
    alive.  If you stay alive long enough, the game table will gradually
    begin to shrink and you will have less room to maneuver.  The strategy
    of this game is to make two gorilla balls run into each other, causing
    both of them to disappear from the game board.
    
    TOMMY'S METEORS has you avoiding falling meteors while your character
    gobbles up blocks of buildings for points.  Periodically new buildings
    will appear on the screen to replace the previous ones. The game ends
    when you are hit by a meteor or when you are inadvertently caught
    underneath a new building that appears on the screen.  Your score is
    based upon the amount of time that you are able to survive.
    
    Both games on this disk automatically keep track of the top ten scores,
    have on-line instructions, and work with both color and monochrome
    monitors.
