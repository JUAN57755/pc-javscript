## Information about "NIFTY (FORMERLY ON 1225)"

    NIFTY helps new and casual PC users to create personalized menus to run
    programs, copy, or read files, and do other computer tasks at the touch
    of a key.  It even offers password protection to submenus.
    
    Memory-resident, NIFTY can be called up from DOS or popped-up by
    pressing a hotkey.  When called, a help life jacket splashes onto the
    screen ready to save the new PC user faced with a formidable array of
    programs and a flat learning curve.
    
    You can make easy-to-use menus that allow novices to quickly perform
    complicated computing tasks with little or no training.  On-screen help
    files can be inserted to guide even the "first day" user through any
    computerized office operation.  Passwords and security levels are
    available to control access to submenus.
    
    Automatic program scheduling is another useful feature; you can set
    timers to cue and begin processing long or slow sorting and processing
    programs for the dead of night or other slow times.
