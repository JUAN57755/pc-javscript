## Information about "STOCK CHARTS"

    STOCK CHARTS is for the investor with an eye towards technical analysis
    of stocks or mutual funds.  STOCK CHARTS graphically displays the price
    and volume action of stocks or mutual funds by producing charts similar
    to those found in books on technical analysis of the stock market.  The
    program charts high, low, close, volume, and moving averages of stocks,
    mutual funds, or stock averages such as the Dow Jones Industrial
    Average.  STOCK CHARTS is designed for the small investor who keeps
    track of day-to-day stock prices and volume movements through sources
    such as the Wall Street Journal or some other financial publication.
    
    STOCK CHARTS is fully menu-driven and intuitive to operate.  From the
    main menu you can choose to draw charts, list stocks, add/delete/insert
    data, or view data.  Each option presents you with a sub-menu for ease
    of operation.  Three charting options are available: chart high, low,
    close, volume; chart close only; and chart moving average.  The list
    stocks option will show you all stock symbols that are currently in the
    database.  STOCK CHARTS produces high resolution black and white CGA
    graphics and full color EGA graphics.  Charts can also be printed.
