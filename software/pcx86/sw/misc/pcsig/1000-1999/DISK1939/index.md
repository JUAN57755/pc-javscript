## Information about "ALIEN WORLDS"

    Here's an exciting game to show off your VGA screen.  You're space
    walking in your space suit and you have to shoot aliens as they attack.
    The surreal view of outer space -- its detail and color -- make ALIEN
    WORLDS a unique action game.  There are no documentation files with this
    program, but what you need to know is given within the program itself.
    The game is easy to grasp, but not as easy to master.
