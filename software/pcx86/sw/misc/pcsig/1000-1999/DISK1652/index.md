## Information about "TECHNOJOCK'S TURBO TOOLKIT (1651 ALSO)"

    TechnoJock's Turbo Toolkit (TTT) is a comprehensive set of procedures
    and functions for Turbo Pascal and Quick Pascal programmers.  The
    Toolkit is designed for professional programmers, as well as newcomers
    to the Pascal programming environment.

    down, form input procedures, string formatting, a Sidekick Plus style
    directory lister, and much more.  These units are compact and very easy
