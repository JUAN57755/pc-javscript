## Information about "WORD-PART DICTIONARY"

    Get ready for your placement tests while you enhance your word power
    with WORD-PART Dictionary.  The database of this system boasts 500 word
    parts and 2,000 related words with concise definitions.
    
    The program enables you to learn new words with ease and speed since it
    allows you to study a group of related words at a time, each
    stemming from a common root word part.  For example, a search of the
    root "retro" brings up on the screen: retroactive, retrocede,
    retroflex, and retrograde -- along with their definitions.  You get a
    highly selected list of word parts related to about 70 percent of the
    tough words in a typical SAT, ACT, CBAT, or GRE verbal test.  The
    system is menu-driven and has on-line instructions.
