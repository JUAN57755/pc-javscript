## Information about "P-CEM"

    P-CEM is a program that displays the current directory and allows you
    to execute several DOS commands at the touch of a key. It simplifies
    complicated file and directory usage that would be more complicated
    using just the DOS command line.
    
    With P-CEM you can use the cursor pad to select a file from the
    directory, and press a single key to copy, delete, rename, execute,
    view, print or wipe that file. Encrypt and decrypt files, and change
    file attributes. P-CEM can switch between directories and allows you
    to create and delete directories. For other operations, you may
    temporarily shell to DOS and immediately return to the program.
    
    Additional utilities are included. COLOR is a program that allows you
    to change the border color on a CGA monitor, and CURSOR will allow you
    to change the size of the cursor so that it can be located on the
    screen more easily. DISKINFO will state what free space is available
    on a disk, and MEMORY will display your total computer memory and
    currently available memory. READSECT will allow you to view any disk
    sector. (This is useful for looking at the "raw" data of a program or
    finding a lost file.) SYSINFO will display general system
    information of your computer configuration, and REBOOT will reboot your
    computer (same as Ctrl-Alt-Del). REBOOT is a useful program if it
    becomes necessary to reboot the computer in a batch file.
