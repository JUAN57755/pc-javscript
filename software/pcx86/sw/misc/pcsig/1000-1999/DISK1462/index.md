## Information about "HP DESKJET SOFT FONTS & UTILITIES"

    HP Deskjet owners rejoice!  Now a complete soft font package is
    available for the DeskJet.  ELFRING DESKJET SOFTFONT PACKAGE (EDSP) has
    25 different fonts and a lightning fast download program written
    especially for the DeskJet or DeskJet Plus with a 128K or 256K RAM
    cartridge.
    
    EDSP offers more fonts for the deskjet in more sizes than any other
    package (including HP's own).  The download program is fully-functional,
    loading fonts at nearly three times the speed of the HP package.  EDSP
    fonts are available in 6 to 30 point size ranges while HP fonts stop at
    12 points.  Included in this package is an unusual symbol font that
    permits the inclusion of character sized airplanes, umbrellas, trade
    marks, and more in documents.
    
    Soft fonts for the DeskJet are not compatible with LaserJet fonts, so
    many applications, such as MS-WINDOWS, do not support soft fonts for the
    DeskJet.  With some adjustments this package enables DeskJets to fully
    emulate LaserJets, making the DeskJet RAM cartridge worth the price.
    Printer drivers for WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1, Word 5.0, and PC-Write are
    included.
