## Information about "DIETAID 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1579)"

    DIETAID is a diet and menu planner in which the user consults tables of
    calorie, fat, protein and dietary exchange equivalents for each of the
    items in his diet/menu/recipe.  The system can provide a daily allowance
    based on height, weight, age and activity level and compare them to
    actual meal plans or meals consumed.  Personal recipes can be entered in
    the database for future use in menu planning.  Tables of food can be
    amended with items the user will use that have not been included.  The
    table will support up to 3000 items.
    
    DIETAID is valuable to anyone who is interested in diet, meal planning
    and good nutrition.  Doctors, nutritionists and dietary specialists
    would be interested not only in using this program, but could also
    encourage their clients to utilize it in food and menu planning.
