## Information about "ROKMAR ASSETS INVENTORY"

    The ASSETS INVENTORY SYSTEM is an inventory log program from Rokmar that
    enables you to keep track of your home or office assets.
    
    In case of fire, theft, etc., your insurance company will want an
    itemized list of each piece of merchandise, the model numbers, the
    serial numbers, the location the article was kept, the purchase/
    replacement cost, etc.  This information can be difficult to piece
    together with any amount of accuracy after the disaster strikes.
    
    The ASSETS INVENTORY SYSTEM keeps track of all you own, allows for easy
    updating on a regular basis, and provides a detailed inventory report of
    assets sorted by type, location or user defined index.  It is also able
    to generate customized files for importing to spreadsheets or financial
    analysis programs.
    
    You may be amazed to find out how much money you have tied up in
    household/office assets, in what areas this money is concentrated, and
    in what type of merchandise!  This information is useful for capital
    budgeting, tax planning, developing reasonable precautions against
    losses due to theft and fire, and, of course, documentation for
    insurance claims.
    
    The INVENTORY SYSTEM also provides helpful guidance on how to take
    inventory, such as hints concerning often overlooked items: expensive
    clothing articles, landscaping purchases, books, telephones, computer
    software, lighting fixtures, custom curtains, hot water heater, kitchen
    appliances and utensils, tap water filters, children's articles, outside
    articles, items loaned to someone else, important papers, etc.
