## Information about "MANDELBROT & JULIA SET GENERATOR (1076)"

    MANDEL generates and displays marvelously beautiful images based upon
    the recently developed area of mathematics called "fractal geometry."
    With this program, you can create an unlimited number of new images,
    change the colors of the images, and save the images to a disk file.
    Sample images are included, and on-line help suggests numerical values,
    making it easy to begin.
    
    The program has two outstanding features:  the assignment of color masks
    to create an unlimited range of color variations for each image, and the
    ability to zoom in and magnify selected portions of the screen.
    
    MANDEL is a comprehensive program that takes some time to create a new
    image, but once saved to disk the image can be displayed on the screen
    more quickly.  You can also generate Julia images, which are similar to
    the Mandelbrot images, but require different numerical values to create
    the image.  The documentation has suggested readings for more
    information on Mandelbrot and Julia set images.
