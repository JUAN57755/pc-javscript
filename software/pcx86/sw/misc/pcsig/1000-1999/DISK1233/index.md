## Information about "GRADESCAN"

    GRADESCAN is a menu-driven grade-keeping system designed with the busy
    teacher in mind.  Its operation is so simple that it can be used with
    full confidence the very first time.  Menu selectable options include:
    create/select class, enter assignments, enter grades, add new students,
    examine class data, and print reports.
    
    GRADESCAN allows up to 17 classes to be created.  Each class can contain
    50 students and 14 assignments.  The assignments can be weighted and
    student names can be copied into more than one class.
    
    GRADESCAN was developed for teachers by a teacher.  The program includes
    complete instructions on disk, self-explaining menus, and provides
    several sample class exercises for the new or timid user to experiment
    on without hurting anything.
