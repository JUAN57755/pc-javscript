## Information about "SAPPHIRE"

    Each brand of BBS suits a different kind of sysop. SAPPHIRE is
    specifically designed for stores, computer consultants, customer support
    lines, people who have never run a BBS before, and people who have run a
    BBS before and found it too much work.
    
    SAPPHIRE is very easy to set up and maintain. A moderately experienced
    computer user will set it up in less than an hour and spend
    approximately one hour per week performing the various duties required
    of a sysop.
    
    SAPPHIRE's design is quite flexible, so you can modify it to look the
    way you want. Multi-line systems are not supported by Sapphire. This
    is in keeping with the "install-and-forget" design of the system, but it
    does mean that Sapphire won't suit everyone.
