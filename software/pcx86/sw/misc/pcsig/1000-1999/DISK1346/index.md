## Information about "CRISP"

    CRISP is a bookkeeping system that can support 250 individual databases,
    making it perfect for property management of multiple commercial or
    investment properties, or for individual accounting for several
    separate projects or companies.
    
    CRISP is completely menu-driven.  You select the property, or account,
    you want to operate with from a menu and then select the operation you
    want from another menu.  Each database has its own journal of receipts
    and disbursements of up to 9,999 entries, chart of accounts of up to
    250 accounts, and payor/payee list of up to 250 names (plus unlimited
    special payor/payees).
    
    For each database, you can display up to three bank account balances,
    create income and expense reports, print checks (with or without payee's
    address for window envelope), reconcile bank statements for each
    property or project, and display delinquency reports.  You can also
    backup all account data to another file for safe keeping.  In addition,
    CRISP can export files of up to a year of monthly account totals to
    Lotus 1-2-3.  CRISP makes written reports including all transactions,
    selected transactions, and annual and monthly totals of accounts.
