## Information about "QPACS"

    QPACS is a personal accounting program that can handle up to nine
    different bank accounts, keep track of user defined budgets, record
    investments, assets and liabilities, and estimate your federal income
    taxes.
    
    For each bank account you may record check amounts, deposits, interest
    and service charges. QPACS can balance the bank statements, and it can
    print out a complete check register or a summary register by user-
    defined categories. The program can also print out a net worth
    calculation report, which is based upon the information from the
    checking accounts, the investments, and the assets and liabilities.
    QPACS also has a built-in address and phone number index card system
    which is very helpful for keeping track of the people and businesses
    that are important to your finances, and a household inventory file. The
    latest release also prints checks and includes a recurring check file.
