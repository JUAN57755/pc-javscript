## Information about "WORDMASTER"

    WordMaster is a full-function wordprocessor so easy to use you can
    be up and writing before ever reading the documentation. This is made
    possible by WordMaster's outstanding menu system.  All the basic
    wordprocessing commands are included in it with online help to explain
    each command.
    
    The excellent documentation offers clear explanations and examples of
    using the more sophisticated capabilities that have become standard in
    wordprocessors. The serious user will quickly be employing features that
    include: multiple fonts, time-saving macros, search and replace,
    cutting-and-pasting blocks of text on multiple documents, headers and
    footers, automatic page numbering, the ability to customize the working
    environment and much more.
    
    These capabilities combined with its ease of use have prompted many
    to declare WordMaster superior to any other wordprocessor they have ever
    used -- even top-of-the-line commercial products.
