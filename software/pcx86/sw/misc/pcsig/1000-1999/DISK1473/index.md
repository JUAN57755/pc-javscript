## Information about "HYPERSKETCH"

    HYPERSKETCH is a program that helps you to create "layered" diagrams
    which can include boxes, lines and/or text.  Create colorful diagrams
    with text for explaining a concept, giving instructions or documenting
    a program.  The layered diagrams can be used as a menu system to execute
    your programs or perform DOS functions.  HYPERSKETCH can be used for
    educational purposes, dataflow diagrams, and screen prototyping.
    
    Each diagram occupies a full screen.  Boxes can be drawn in any
    combination of color, size and position.  Text can be displayed in
    different colors and the lines can turn corners and have arrow heads.
    Any object of the diagram can contain a layered diagram beneath it on a
    totally separate screen.  Layered diagrams can be accessed by pressing
    a key while the cursor is on the object which has the diagram beneath
    it.  A maximum of 99 levels of diagrams may be created per file,
    depending upon available computer memory.
    
    Any diagram on the screen can be printed, or written to an ASCII file
    for later use with a wordprocessor.  The program has extensive editing
    features: objects can be moved, cut and pasted, edited, saved and read
    from a disk file into memory.  You have two independent working areas
    allowing you to work with two diagrams at the same time.
