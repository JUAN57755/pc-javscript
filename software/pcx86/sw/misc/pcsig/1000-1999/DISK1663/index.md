    FIREWORKS is a screen blanking utility for Microsoft Windows.  When
    keyboard and mouse buttons are inactive for a user-specified length of
    time, the screen is blanked and simulated fireworks shoot off on the
    screen to let the user know the computer is still alive.  In "active"
    mode (selecting the FIREWORK icon) the mouse cursor becomes a plane
    flying amongst the fireworks.  The screen blank can also be blanked
    voluntarily using a hot-key.
