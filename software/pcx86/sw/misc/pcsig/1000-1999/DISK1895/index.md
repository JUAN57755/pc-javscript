## Information about "M2JFTOOLS"

    This collection contains library modules that provide new, useful
    procedures to be incorporated into Modula-2 programs, to either produce
    new effects or make it easier to achieve older effects.  Also included
    are programs to make the programming process easier.  This system offers
    control over:
    
    ~ Date and time information with user-selectable formats
    
    ~ File reading and writing of strings, numbers and Booleans
    
    ~ Printing of strings, numbers and Booleans
    
    ~ Printer control codes
    
    ~ Additional string procedures.
    
    Other features include comprehensive screen control:  cursor control,
    partial or total clearing, Boolean prompts, inverse video boxes for data
    input, including decimal point, data entry, editing and display of
    reals, screen editing of strings, and integers.
    
    The data functions provide keyboard entry, FileInOut, printing of all
    types of data items, and entry of logical variables.  The Math1 library
    module provides the trigonometric functions.  Those modules that employ
    real arithmetic are presented in two versions, one for those with a math
    coprocessor and the other for those without.  There is even an improved
    programming environment that liberates you from constant mouse use, and
    gives you greater editing control.  All the tasks that are necessary
    when developing a Modula-2 program can be executed from one menu.
