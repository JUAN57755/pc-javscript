## Information about "BIG EVENT"

    BIGEVENT warns you 10 days in advance of special events on your social
    calendar such as birthdays, anniversaries and special days of the year
    such as Mother's Day.  After all, it's your memory -- not your heart --
    that needs a hand.  You enter all your special events in a text file
    according to a special program format.  Once the data is entered, every
    time you turn on your computer it will tell you which events are coming
    up soon.
