## Information about "REALQUIK"

    REALQUIK is a "property management" program that will allow you to form
    a real estate database for all of your listings.  Entries in the
    database may be recalled rapidly based on the format of the Multiple
    Listing Service books.  For example, if you want to recall all
    houses in the 80 to 100,000 dollar range, or all houses with pools,
    only a few keystrokes and a couple of seconds later and you will
    have your data.  REALQUIK allows for complete market analysis of
    properties and allows you to make your own listing screen to suit your
    needs.
    
    REALQUIK performs numerous functions: listing management, recall homes/
    properties based on price/area/street or any number of search
    parameters, market analysis, agent sales analysis, buyer qualification,
    produce amortization schedules, produce mortgage comparison tables,
    calculate balloon payments, calculate commissions/fees/company dollars,
    and many more.
