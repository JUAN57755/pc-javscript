## Information about "POWER SHEETS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1284)"

    PC Magazine calls POWER SHEETS ``the most powerful, pure spreadsheet on
    the market'' and labels it ``easy to use.''  Corporations such as Ford,
    AMOCO and First Chicago are using it to develop sophisticated turnkey
    applications beyond the capabilities of other spreadsheets.
    
    POWER SHEETS offers three-dimensional data presentations with the
    ability to rotate the data cube to view slices in other orientations.  A
    special language gives POWER SHEETS programmability.  Pop-up menus guide
    users through all functions.
    
    Other spreadsheets operate on ranges; POWER SHEETS goes further, using
    lists involving a combination of ranges, cell references, or formulae.
    Another feature allows it to base the bounds of a range on the values of
    other cells, and provides for true date and time math.  All functions
    are fully recursive and can be nested to any depth.  The upshot is the
    availability of 16 million cells.
    
    POWER SHEETS reads and writes .DIF files either row-wise or column-wise.
    It reads and writes ASCII files either non-delimited or delimited with
    any choice of delimiters.  Its rich function library includes trig and
    log functions, statistical and Boolean functions, yes-no-maybe logic,
    and sophisticated case function.
