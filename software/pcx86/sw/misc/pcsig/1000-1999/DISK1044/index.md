## Information about "CHIRO PATIENT TRACKING SYSTEM"

    Chiro was written in conjunction with several physicians to provide a
    specific service in a medical office. The system maintains a detailed
    patient data base and eliminates the nuisance of typing claim forms. It
    uses friendly and colorful screens, is easy installed, with no
    cumbersome manuals required. It is completely menu driven, with on-line
    help always available. Backup, purge, and restore of patient data is
    provided. Claim form data is printed directly on form HCFA-1500. Other
    printed output includes reports of outstanding claims and standard offic
    statements. It provides automatic sort and merge of new patient records
    and can rapidly fetch any patient record for analysis or claim form
    processing. Each registered copy is personalized with name, address,
    telephone, social security, and ID numbers of the physician. Similar
    medical products on the market retail for thousands of dollars.
