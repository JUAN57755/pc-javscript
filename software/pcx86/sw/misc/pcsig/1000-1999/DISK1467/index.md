## Information about "FRIGATE"

    FRIGATE is a strategy game which pits you and your ship against a Soviet
    fleet of vessels. The object is to destroy as many of the opposing
    ships as possible while avoiding destruction of your own.
    
    Points are awarded for destroying your enemy while avoiding their
    missiles. Your ship, a nuclear-powered guided missile frigate, has many
    advantages over its Soviet counterparts but you are outnumbered by a
    large margin. Operating in an area of 1,000,000 square miles, you have
    radar, sonar, jamming equipment, anti-missile capabilities and three
    types of ordnance at your disposal.
    
    FRIGATE is played from three on-screen windows -- a main window which
    gives you an overview of your ship's status, an options window which
    changes in accordance with the commands you select and a command window
    from which you issue those commands. Your ship's status and position,
    and the location of the enemy are updated frequently. FRIGATE is a
    challenging and stimulating game that will provide many, many hours of
    entertainment.
