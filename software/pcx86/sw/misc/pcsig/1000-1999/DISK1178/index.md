## Information about "BOOK MINDER"

    BOOK MINDER is a book-cataloging system designed for both personal and
    business use.  It can be used with books, magazines, newspapers, or
    almost any other published material.  BOOK MINDER allows you to catalog
    a library and then locate a book or article in a magazine, by any one of
    up to 21 characteristics.  Entries can be made for individual articles.
    This allows you to list the individually unique information contained in
    each article.
    
    BOOK MINDER is completely menu-driven, easy to operate, and allows
    three levels of information cataloging.  The three levels are:
    standard,
    research, and librarian.  Each level provides a progressively greater
    detail of information that can be stored for each entry.
    
    BOOK MINDER can be used to run a database search business, providing
    different levels of information to customers.
