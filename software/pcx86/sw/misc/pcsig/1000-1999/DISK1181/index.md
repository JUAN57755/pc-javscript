## Information about "FOUR PROGRAMS FOR WRITERS"

    BASIC ENGLISH can tell you how many words in your poem or prose are on
    the magic list of 850 words scholars agree are simple and most
    understandable to the average reader.  The program can flag words
    excluded from the magic list and is valuable for technical writers.
    File Descriptions:
    
    -------- ---  BASIC ENGLISH.
    BE       EXE  The main program for BASIC ENGLISH.
    BE       DF   The main data file.
    BE       DOC  Documentation for BASIC ENGLISH.
    BASMAN   BAT  Batch file to copy documentation to your printer.
    
    Roses are red, violets are blue, POETEASE will rhyme most anything for
    you!
    
    POETEASE generates rhyming, consonant or assonant endings for poetry.
    One drawback: the program matches spelling only.  Hence, POETEASE will
    not list `liar' as a rhyme word for `buyer.'
    File Descriptions:
    
    -------- ---  POETEASE.
    POETDOC  BAT  Batch file to copy documentation to your printer.
    PZ       EXE  The main program for POETEASE.
    INITS         Data file.
    ENDS          Data file.
    VOWELS        Data file.
    POETEASE DOC  Text documentation for POETEASE.
    
    Writers -- Analyze your writing style.  Step back and take a cool look
    at how you do it.
    
    STYLED and STYLIST chart word and letter patterns in ASCII text files to
    help you revise, analyze and compare your writing style.  The programs
    only work with ASCII text files, but included on this disk is a utility
    program that converts any non-ASCII text file into ASCII format (this
    includes documents).
    
    These two programs can save you time in your revisions and help improve
    your writing style.  STYLED analyzes each text for word length,
    punctuation, syntax or nominalization.  You can view a text file without
    leaving the program, and you can shell to DOS. STYLLIST does the same
    thing as STYLED, except that it records your long words, forms of ``to
    be,'' and potential nominalizations in a disk file.
    File Descriptions:
    
    AUTOEXEC BAT  Start-up batch file.
    STUDNESE TXT  Sample text file.
    STPAUL   TXT  Sample text file.
    REVTEACH TXT  Sample text file.
    REVSTUD  TXT  Sample text file.
    UNWS     EXE  ASCII utility.
    UNWS     DOC  Documentation for UNWS.EXE.
    TEACHESE TXT  Sample text file.
    
    INVENT helps you create beautiful metaphors from words that you supply
    to the program.  You enter up to 40 words into each of the these
    categories, nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and then let the
    program do the work.
    
    The program then generates sentences, which you may use in your
    wrighting endeavors, quickly one screen full at a time.  You can request
    as many re-scramblings of the same data as you like.
