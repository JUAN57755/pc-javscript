## Information about "TOMMY'S SAUCER"

    Climb into a flying saucer cockpit to battle enemy saucers.  Your
    mission is to destroy invading ships with the help of your ray beam.  A
    point is scored every time you destroy an enemy saucer but the score
    reduces by one for every 30 clock ticks.  The mission terminates when
    your shields are blasted and your ship is destroyed.
    
    TOMMY'S SAUCER has various exotic alien display panels to show the
    energy and shield level, range, target crosshairs lock-in status, and
    aiming coordinates.  You use a command panel at the bottom of the
    screen.  The program has a sound effect toggle, a demo mode, function
    key control, an optional expanded view screen, and nine levels of
    difficulty.  The sound and color show is nonstop and akin to a sci-fi
    movie.  Runs on mono or color.
