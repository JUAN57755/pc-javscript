## Information about "DISK_TAG & FONEBOOK"

    DISK_TAG allows you to print custom disk labels, directory listings,
    and even disk sleeves for your diskettes.
    
    DISK_TAG is a disk label program with the added feature of being able
    to create sleeves for your disks. When you have those couple of disks
    that just don't seem to have any sleeves for them, it's nice to be able
    to make your own.
    
    The program also makes sleeves for 3.5" disks. It's not necessary to
    have sleeves for the smaller disks but it also leaves you without a
    place for your directory listings. The sleeve the program prints for
    these disks has been tested in several disk holders and fits fine.
    
    Sleeves or labels printed by DISK_TAG can include a complete listing of
    all the subdirectories on a disk, or only the root directory, in
    alphabetical or actual order, at your option.  DISK_TAG will also print
    the contents of .ARC or .ZIP files, if necessary. A line for comments
    is provided as well, printed in condensed print to allow for longer
    comments.
    
    FONEBOOK lets you use your computer as your personal telephone
    directory and will even dial the numbers for you.
    
    If you're like most people, you probably have names, addresses, and
    phone numbers scribbled on little bits and pieces of paper all over the
    place.  FONEBOOK helps you organize all those bits and pieces into a
    single database of names, addresses, and phone numbers.
    
    With FONEBOOK you can:
    
    ~ Create and add names, addresses, and phone numbers
    
    ~ Send your database to an ASCII file for easy editing
    
    ~ Browse through the database
    
    ~ Search on any field in the database
    
    ~ Quickly find and dial (with modem) any phone number
    
    ~ Print the entire database or only selected records or fields
