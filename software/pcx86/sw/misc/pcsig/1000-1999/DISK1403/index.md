## Information about "LOVEDOS (PENNAME NOW ON #1710)"

    This program gives a whole new meaning to ``personal'' in personal
    computer.  Pre-install LOVEDOS on a friend's machine and sit back and
    watch 'em blush!  With each keystroke, a provocative remark flashes to
    the screen, line after line, putting the moves on the operator.  A sexy
    rework of the old INSULTS program.  Nothing too suggestive, but choose
    your victim carefully anyway.  At last, a truly user friendly computer!
