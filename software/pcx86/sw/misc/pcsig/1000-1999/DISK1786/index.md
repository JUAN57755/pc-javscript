## Information about "EXCHEQUER"

    This checkbook program is designed primarily for home users and small
    businesses wishing to automate and simplify the process of paying their
    bills.
    
    EXCHEQUER avoids the complexities of most small accounting
    programs, yet provides many features which support small business
    accounting. It also offers powerful and flexible reporting
    capabilities. Any part of the check register can be printed in
    chronological order, sorted by category, or sorted by payee. You can
    list all transactions in a single category or to/from a single party.
    EXCHEQUER even prints an income statement, and any report can be sent to
    a printer, the screen, or a file.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Pay all of your regular monthly bills with one keystroke per check
    ~ Looks and works just like a regular checkbook register
    
    ~ Works with virtually all types of continuous-feed checks
    
    ~ Supports an unlimited number of accounts
    
    ~ Store up to 4000 transactions
    
    ~ Assign each transaction to one of 255 user-defined categories.
    Reporting functions allow the user to sort the check register by
    category, making tax preparation a breeze!
    
    ~ Offers 10 different report types which facilitate record keeping and
    expense analysis
    
    ~ Handle transaction amounts up to $99,999.99 and register balances up
    to $999,999.99 or down to -$99,999.99. The maximum expenditures or
    deposits to any single category can be up to $999,999.99.
