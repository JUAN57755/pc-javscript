## Information about "GOOGOL MATH GAMES"

    Your kids will love these three top-notch arcade-style math games,
    designed to make learning basic math fun. Original twists on popular
    arcade themes allow these programs to do addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, and division. The games are so entertaining and
    colorful, the children won't realize they're learning. In fact, even
    parents enjoy them just for the games themselves.
    
    At the lowest skill levels, the games are playable by very young
    children. If they are not yet able to read, parents can help them get
    started. Older children, 5-10, will usually be able to figure out all
    of the games by themselves. Finally, at the highest skill levels, the
    games are a challenge to everyone!
    
    The graphics are better than many other math programs -- complete color
    control, variable skill levels, and personalized congratulations for
    every correct answer are only a few of the features that make this a
    top-notch program.
