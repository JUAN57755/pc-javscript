## Information about "THE NAVIGATOR VERSION 1.30E"

    NAVIGATOR is a hard disk menu program that lets you easily execute any
    program having the extension EXE, COM, or BAT.  The menu has room for 34
    programs with path information limited to five subdirectories.  A
    summary of all menu items and parameters can be printed.  If a command
    is not available on your menu, you can temporarily exit to DOS to
    perform other operations.
    
    NAVIGATOR includes other powerful features, too.  It can keep a log of
    your work and lets you password-protect your programs on the menu.  The
    program also features a screen save that blanks the screen if the
    computer has not been used for five minutes.  This prevents screen
    burn-in of the menus.
    
    The menu is easy to use, has on-line help, and an automatic
    installation program for quick set-up.
