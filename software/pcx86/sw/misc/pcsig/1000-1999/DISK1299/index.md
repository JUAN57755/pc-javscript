## Information about "UTILITIES GALORE"

    Make your printer serve you better with this collection of utilities.
    There's even a game thrown in for fun!
    
    DIRPRN prints a disk directory sorted in various ways to make it easy to
    find a file.  ENVPRN turns your computer into an electric typewriter for
    quickly dashing off addresses on an envelope in a variety of fonts.
    LABPRN works similarly but is specifically formatted to handle labels,
    such as for binders/drawers.  MERPRN merges several separate text files
    into one formatted printed text.  SETPRN sets the printer parameters
    prior to using a print spooler.  XTRPRN extracts and prints call
    declarations and comments from Turbo Pascal source files.
    
    All the programs let you select the print quality, text style, margin
    width, page numbering, printer port, and line spacing.  They can be
    added as batch files to run whenever needed.
    
    COLORE lets you choose the colors your monitor will display when
    your system first boots-up.  You can select from 16 different colors for
    the foreground, background, and border of your monitor.
    
    SURVIVAL is a game that requires quick reflexes.  With a boxing glove
    you must punch monsters before they descend to the bottom of the screen,
    sending them back to the top.
    
    LABEL computerizes your personal address/telephone directory for easy
    reference and printing of reports and labels.  Menu options let you
    print: address labels (using standard 15/16" x 3-1/2" wide labels),
    list of all records (done with two entries side-by-side on 8-1/2" x 11"
    paper), telephone list (only those records with a telephone number are
    printed), and individual records you select.  Handles both three and
    four line addresses, automatically suppressing blank lines.
    
    DOCFORM lets you add printing instructions to any text file to
    specify boldface print, underlined print, margins, double or triple
    spacing, headers, and footers -- which then print correctly on
    almost every printer.
