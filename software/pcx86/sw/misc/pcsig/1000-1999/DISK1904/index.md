## Information about "EVALUATE/KYM-DISK UTILITY"

    EVALUATE fills a niche in the computer mathematical analysis market.
    Although there are many calculator emulators, there are not many
    programs that allow you to enter complex equations as they are
    written and then, by hitting the return key, get them solved.  In fact,
    EVALUATE solves as you write, providing intermediate results whenever
    there are enough logical operators entered.
    
    EVALUATE will solve problems such as pi^2*sin(log(tan(x1)))
    if you enter them as written.  This can be accomplished via a dialogue
    box or simply by entering the formulae at the command line.  A very
    wide variety of operations are supported, including sophisticated date
    and statistical functions.  It can operate in terminate and stay
    resident (TSR) pop-up mode, and can print its results.
    
    KYM-DISK is a collection of utilities, including a copy program, a
    directory deleter, a file mover, a hard disk access time checker, and a
    program to display DOS's internal disk parameter table. Source files
    (Turbo 2.0) are included.
    
    ~ MOVE enables you to move files and subdirectories from one directory
    to another. It does not copy physically, but rearranges the disk
    directory tree structure in a suitable manner.
    
    ~ YCOPY, a DOS XCOPY-like copy utility, with which files and whole
    directory structures can be copied.
    
    ~ KILLDIR erases a directory and its complete contents.
    
    ~ HD-SPEED measures your hard disk's average cylinder access time.
    
    ~ DISKPARA displays DOS' internal disk parameter table.
