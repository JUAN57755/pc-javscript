## Information about "FLOPPY DISK MENU SYSTEM"

    Attention floppy disk users!   Have you ever been frustrated by
    cumbersome DOS syntax?  Have you ever accessed a floppy only to
    discover
    you didn't remember the commands to start your program?  ROKMAR FLOPPY
    DISK MENU SYSTEM is a program designed especially for you!
    
    With ROKMAR FLOPPY MENU DISK SYSTEM you enter DOS commands, program
    names, or batch files on a menu only once.  Now, they are always
    available at the touch of a key!  Easy to use and to set up.  No need to
    spend hours learning a complicated menu language.  Only DOS and batch
    file commands are used.
    
    Not a lot of room to spare on those floppies?  ROKMAR FLOPPY DISK MENU
    SYSTEM comes in two compact sizes, 14K or 25K and allows you to save
    different menus on each floppy.  In addition, eight convenient
    utilities
    are included to help you manage your files.
