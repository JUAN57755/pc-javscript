## Information about "I FOUND IT"

    I FOUND IT offers an absolutely simple database for people who keep
    lists of other people as well as things. For home or business, I FOUND
    IT sets up the database with 19 predefined fields that are perfect for
    things like Christmas mailing lists and Little League rosters.
    
    All the user has to do is hit a couple of keys and begin entering
    names, addresses and phone numbers. I FOUND IT will print the data as
    mailing labels, records, or in tabular form. It will find individual
    records, print selected records, merge two files and user change the
    names of the fields. The menus and prompts are the nearest thing to
    total simplicity. Multiple files are allowed on each disk.
