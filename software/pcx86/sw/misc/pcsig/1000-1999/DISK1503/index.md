## Information about "GETFILE AND MORE"

    WISEDIR streamlines and updates the old DOS DIR command. It shows ALL
    your files -- including system, hidden, and read-only files -- in ALL
    your subdirectories.
    
    Copy to the screen or print the file list of filenames with attributes,
    file size, and date and time of creation. WISEDIR also tells you the
    system date and time, and provides a summary of disk space available and
    used. WISEDIR can be used on networks.
    
    SETATTR makes it easy to set or change the attributes of your files.
    
    With a single command, you can make a file normal, hidden, read only,
    or a system file. SETATTR saves time by supporting wild cards and
    directories. Change the attributes of entire blocks of files. It
    displays the names and new or old attributes of changed files. A help
    function is included. Networks are supported.
    
    If you've ever experienced the frustration of looking for a rarely-used
    file on a crowded disk, you will appreciate this utility. GETFILE will
    immediately find a file on a disk drive, even if it is hidden!
    
    Tell GETFILE the drive and filename and it will search all directories
    and subdirectories until it is found... and then switch you to that
    subdirectory! OK, so it's been a long time and you're not sure what the
    filename is. GETFILE can deal with wildcards. Get as close as you can
    to the vaguely remembered name and it will offer you a list of those
    files that match your request, and the subdirectory path to find them.
    
    GETFILE is especially useful for finding files on a hard disk.
    
    Like to increase the amount of storage available on your floppy disks?
    Format your disks with MAXI FORM and you can expand storage on your 360K
    disks by one-sixth: you get 420K bytes free.  On 1.2 Meg drives, you get
    1.4 meg; on 720K 3.5 inch drives you get 800K; and on 1.44 Meg 3.5 inch
    drives you get an incredible 1.6 Meg per disk!  You also get 800K on a
    normal 360K 5.25 inch disk in a 1.2 Meg drive.
    
    It's as simple as putting a disk in a slot and typing MAXI A: (with a
    few command line options, if you wish).  The default "fast format"
    method can create a 420K disk in under 40 seconds, while an optional
    verify switch lets you check each track as it is formatted.  MAXI
    created disks are not bootable.
    
    Forget the DOS backup command.  Now there's COPYALL which backs up hard
    disk files quicker and neater.  COPYALL copies files in alphabetical
    order.  That means folks with messy hard disks can use it to bring
    order to their files.  Happily, it uses wild cards and shows the
    name of each file as it's copied.  COPYALL works on any file as long as
    it is not larger than the diskette it is copied to.
    
    FILEVIEWER -- a alternative to the hassle of DOS. If you still can't
    find your magic DOS-decoder ring, try this file manager.
    
    Every DOS command can be executed with a maximum of two keystrokes. Move
    smoothly from file to file, directory to directory. Sort entire
    directories for viewing on screen by name, extension, age, or size of
    files.  Tag files for mass copying and deleting. A thoughtful touch is
    the confirmation prompt to protect against accidental deletion or
    copying over existing files.
    
    FILEVIEWER provides an execution menu that calls application programs
    in two quick keystrokes. Flip between displaying 20 sorted files at a
    time with size and date information, or 80 files at a time with only
    the filenames.
