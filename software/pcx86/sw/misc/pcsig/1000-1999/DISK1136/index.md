## Information about "SEARCHLIGHT BBS"

    Looking for a bulletin board system that's both powerful and
    easy-to-use? Take a look at SEARCHLIGHT BBS.
    
    Unlike other bulletin board systems, SEARCHLIGHT BBS is user friendly
    with both you (the system operator) and those who call in to your
    system. It has an easy to understand menu command system, so users who
    call in to your system need no documentation or help from you to use the
    bulletin board system. If any help is needed, the program has an on-line
    help system. Moreover, it has some significant features, such as
    optional ANSI graphics and color selections for the screen,
    customized menus, public message boards, private mail, a full-screen
    text editor (compatible with WordStar commands), and a file transfer
    system with both Xmodem and Ymodem transfer protocols.
    
    SEARCHLIGHT BBS has password protection and 255 levels of security,
    letting you control access to your system. Like other bulletin boards,
    this one can be left unattended while callers leave messages and
    transfer files to and from your board. The program lets you specify an
    upload/download ratio for all who use the file transfer system, so there
    is a fair trade-off of programs.
    
    There is a complete electronic mail system with up to 24 message
    subsections, each with up to 300 messages. SEARCHLIGHT BBS has enough
    system operator utilities so you can easily manage the system from a
    remote location, and also shell to DOS to run a program or DOS command.
