## Information about "EZ-DISKCOPY"

    Once EZ-DISKCOPY reads the contents of a disk into memory, you can make
    as many copies as you want without your PC rereading the original disk.
    Make unlimited copies after a single master disk read.  Just like a
    dedicated hardware duplicator (which can cost thousands), and just about
    as fast!  The DOS DISKCOPY command spends about 27 seconds loading data
    on every copy.  EZ-DISKCOPY does it only once, saving almost a minute
    every three disks.  Even better, the program verifies the copy during
    each operation.  Map disk usage and get sides and sectors information
    about a disk.  If you choose, you do it all without typing in a single
    command.  Just scroll across the pull-down menu and hit Enter.  As an
    option, you can use single-character commands.
    
    Other features include verify, format only, compare, directory
    information, extensive on-line help, and more.  Extensive, easy-to-read
    documentation is included in the package.  The only things to be
    wary of are memory-resident programs which chew into the memory needed
    for EZ-DISKCOPY.
