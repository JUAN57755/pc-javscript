## Information about "PREGNANT AND WEIGHT CONTROL"

    PREGNANT can help a woman with unstable menstrual cycles track the
    times when she is most likely, and least likely, to become pregnant.
    
    PREGNANT takes into account age, height, weight, the dates of each
    menstrual cycle and body temperature for each day of the past two
    months.  It then displays on the screen the average length and stability
    of the menstrual cycle and the period of ovulation.  Using this data,
    the program can predict with a high degree of accuracy when the next
    menstrual and ovulation periods will begin.  Data for up to two people
    can be stored and analyzed.
    
    WEIGHT CONTROL is a collection of dieting utilities to help you
    in your weight-loss program.
    
    Assess your dieting habits through a questionnaire.  Calculate your
    average weight loss over a period of time; how long it will take to
    reach a certain weight based upon the amount lost each week; daily
    caloric intake to maintain or lose weight; and how many calories you
    have been consuming each meal of the day.  A printout may be obtained
    for the calculations concerning your average weight loss and your
    calorie consumption.
