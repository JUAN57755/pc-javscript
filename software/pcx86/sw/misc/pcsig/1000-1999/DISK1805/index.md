## Information about "AMORT70"

    This loan amortization program also specializes notes.  You can
    calculate monthly or weekly home or personal loan amortization, and
    daily, weekly, or monthly interest on notes with a set repayment
    amount.
    
    Both the loan and note menus will walk you through the numbers by
    prompting you for information.  Who is the report prepared for?  What is
    the amount?  The interest rate?  The period?  The calculations are fast
    and easy to understand.  Great for the professional who does a lot of
    calculating.
