## Information about "PYRAMID SOLITAIRE"

    The old game of pyramid solitaire is even better when your computer
    deals and keeps score -- you just enjoy the game.  Twenty-eight cards
    are dealt in the form of a pyramid.  The pyramid has seven rows of
    cards.  This is composed of successive rows of one to seven cards.  Each
    card is overlapped by two cards of the row below. The last row, which
    contains seven cards, are turned face up.  The object is to remove all
    cards from the pyramid and from the remainder of the deck by simple
    addition using any two cards available for play.  The two cards must add
    up to 13 points.
    
    This top-notch software package comes with all the extras.  There is
    mouse support during the playing of the game.  It allows dealing of the
    cards either face up or face down.  There are two modes of play,
    multiple redeals or a single deal.  It allows you to replay the
    previously dealt hand.  You can even control the speed of dealing and
    elect to view the shuffling of the cards just to keep the computer
    honest.  Graphics are impressive, clear, and easy to follow.
