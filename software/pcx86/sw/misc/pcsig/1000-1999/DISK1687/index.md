## Information about "READ.COM AND READIT"

    A fast text file reader, READ.COM pages, scrolls, and searches in ASCII
    files. The screen-switching option lets you prepare a table of contents
    for a file without direct switching to any screen. The program offers
    no written documentation and limited help on screen.
    
    THE TEXT FILE READER (READIT) allows users to scroll, page, and print
    on-line documents.  All commands are displayed on a horizontal menu bar.
    An intuitive interface provides a straightforward source for on-line
    help.  READIT provides the means to distribute manuals, instructions,
    procedures and other documents, royalty free, to users with a wide range
    of computer experience.  Users without wordprocessing experience can be
    brought "up to speed" in minutes.
    
    Using READIT with your text file requires that text be prepared as shown
    in the documentation.  Control over formatted printing and screen
    display is provided so documents come out looking professional --
    printer or screen.
