## Information about "VIBRATING, ROTATING, AND COOLING"

    VIBRATING, ROTATING, and COOLING is a program that allows you to view
    and manipulate surfaces that are created according to a mathematical
    function.  This should be of interest to the math and engineering
    student and teacher.
    
    The main program, SURFACE.EXE, has six predefined functions plus an
    option to create a mathematical function of your own.  Once a function
    is chosen, the program graphically demonstrates the results of the
    function on a plane surface.  During the graphic mode you can change the
    speed, the axis of rotation, and the magnification of the image.  The
    program also has the option to include a trace of the image on the
    screen and a help window.
    
    VIBRATING, ROTATING, and COOLING is a versatile program that is
    compatible with CGA, EGA, CGA with a monochrome monitor, and VGA.  In
    addition to the main program, this disk has two demonstration programs
    for computers that have smaller memory.  An MS-Windows version is
    available to registered users.
