## Information about "EDDY AND TPOP"

    EDDY (EDit DirectorY) lets you edit the elements of a directory entry.
    These are filename, date, time, and file attributes.
    
    The program has commands to copy and move a file, as well as delete
    and/or destroy a file (or files). Additional commands let you view the
    contents of a file, and patch the data. A provision is made for
    viewing the directory in hex or text, as well as a "bit-stripping"
    feature that translates WordStar into ASCII files.
    
    A single keystroke inserts the current date and time into any directory
    entry.  Changes made to directory entries are not written to disk until
    you choose to do so. Also provided is an undo function. EDDY has
    extensive help, available at any time.
    
    TPOP is a memory-resident printer utility to use with any application.
    TPOP lets you use your printer directly as a typewriter or you can edit
    a full screen of text.  While editing, you can mark blocks of text to
    send to the printer.
    
    The left margin of the text is located wherever the print head is
    positioned before printing and lets you line up the printer for
    envelopes and labels.  Control codes can be sent to the printer.  You
    can direct the output from TPOP to any port (parallel or serial --
    LPT1, LPT2, COM1, or COM2), and you can permanently swap the addresses
    of printer ports.
