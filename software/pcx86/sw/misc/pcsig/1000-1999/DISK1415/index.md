## Information about "SS1 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1414)"

    This combo of programs solves 70% of your computing needs!  This
    integrated program combines a wordprocessor, a list/data manager,
    communications, a mid-size spreadsheet (64 columns by 255 rows), and a
    file and directory browser.  To make the program even more
    comprehensive, pop-up aids are a keystroke away anywhere in the system.
    These include a calculator, an aid for graphing data, file/directory
    viewing, DOS shell interface, and a utility to make macros or smart
    keys.
    
    Packed with features, the wordprocessor offers functions normally found
    only in the top of-the-line packages.  The commands are unique to this
    program, but are easy to learn and fast.  The mailing list manager uses
    standard text files, can edit columns, and sort, select and print
    records as reports or mailing labels.  The spreadsheet has all the
    standard functions, plus handling multiple pages.
    
    The communications program is one of the broadest on the market.  It can
    communicate through almost every modem.  However, this tremendous
    flexibility requires you to configure it for your particular system the
    first time you use it.  The file and directory browser/manager, on the
    other hand, is fairly easy to use and a great help in dealing with hard
    disk housekeeping.  All the commands found in many separate programs are
    at your fingertips: backups, deletions, printing, viewing and directory
    alterations.
    
    The pop-ups include a calculator, file and directory checker, a print
    screen utility, a graph maker, and programmable "hot" or "smart"
    keys (macros).  The calculator supports decimal, hex, and binary for
    basic arithmetic functions.  The help system provides instant access to
    more than 100 screens of context-sensitive help.
