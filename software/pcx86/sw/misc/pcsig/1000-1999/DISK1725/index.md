## Information about "BSIM"

    College and high school Biology instructors -- You will find BSIM
    especially interesting. In classrooms equipped with PCs, BSIM can
    create simulated ecological systems to be used as models of actual
    biological systems. The program provides fun reinforcement of the
    basic subject matter covered in class and encourages the mental
    manipulation of conceptual elements well beyond standard
    calculation-phase gymnastics. The model for the program is an aquatic
    ecosystem,
    but the general features can be applied across a broad range of other
    ecosystems.
    
    Sample stagnant and circulated flask environments, leave open or
    closed to oxygen and carbon-dioxide atmospheres, choose light or dark,
    depth, and choice of sample location according to a grid. Temperature
    and pH are assumed constant and optimum. Also available is a readout
    of solution elements for the sample taken.
    
    "Pseudogenomes" are projections of real organisms, complete with
    physical structures and processes determined by 13 changeable elements
    set by the user. Organisms feed and grow, using a simplified carbon
    chemistry. They are capable of reproduction or reduction with
    sampling possible at each generation. BSIM allows for new organisms or
    the "reseeding" of old ones at first generation. BSIM has a simple
    printer facility and easy menus.
    
    The registration fee provides the user with technical data and program
    utilities to assist program analysis, and an experimenter's manual for
    ten experiments. These experiments cover sampling techniques,
