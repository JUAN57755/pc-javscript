## Information about "SPC-INVENTORY PLUS"

    SPC-INVENTORY is a business inventory program that will allow you to
    record an item's description, location, unit cost, last unit cost, unit
    price, quantity on hand, quantity on order, and up to three
    suppliers. For each item you may constantly update the sales and
    purchases to date. You may also update an item's price at any time. The
    program also allows for two other prices based on percentage
    factor of the standard price. This could be useful for fast sale
    lists. An inventory report can be generated using the last unit
    cost, thus representing the current value or replacement costs.
    Other reports include various sales and purchases reports, supplier
    listing, minimum order report, on-hand report, period usage report of
    quantities, and inventory report based on actual unit cost. The
    period reports generated could be especially useful to monitor
    profit from sales.
