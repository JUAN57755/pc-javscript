## Information about "PAYROLL LITE 2 OF 2 (1547)"

    This easy-to-use module provides a very efficient way to record
    important information such as: hire date, earnings, deductions,
    vacation and sick time, overtime and holiday pay. It automatically
    calculates gross pay, net pay, deductions and liabilities, prints checks
    and W-2 forms, supports both hourly and salaried employees paid either
    weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly, and fully integrates into
    the General Ledger Module. Allows manual override of deductions and
    includes user-modifiable tax tables you can keep current. Allows
    payroll after the fact. Proper use requires the FINANCE MANAGER II (PC-
    SIG Disk #151).
    
    Up to 1000 employees, 32000 transactions, user-modifiable tax tables,
    user modifiable tax calculations, three additional earnings categories
    and two additional deduction categories with separate tax options; can
    delete paid and posted payroll transactions; supports 80 column printers
    and HP Laserjet checks; generates a complete range of reports, such as:
    quarterly tax summary reports, quarterly tax payments, paid payroll
    recap for your 941 form, and SDI option for employee or employer.
