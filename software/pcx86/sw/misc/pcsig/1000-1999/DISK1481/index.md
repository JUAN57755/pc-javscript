## Information about "ACTIVE LIFE FOR MS-WINDOWS"

    ACTIVE LIFE is an ambitious daily scheduling program which makes the
    desk calendar obsolete.
    
    Keep track of all of your daily time commitments.  Entering individual
    items is as simple as noting on a desk calendar.  There is a great deal
    of flexibilty in that an event can occur at a specific or ``floating''
    time frame.  Rescheduling events is a matter of one or two keystrokes.
    Daily, weekly, monthly, or even annually recurring events can be
    automatically added to the system saving repetitive entries.  Comments
    can also be associated with events using ACTIVE LIFE's helpful notepad
    editor.
    
    ACTIVE LIFE will generate printed reports of up to three months of
    activity and automatically saves past events for easy retrieval.  Since
    ACTIVE LIFE is a MS Windows application, it can be run quickly from any
    other Windows application, is easy to use and is mouse-compatible. This
    program is the cure for the congenitally disorganized.
