## Information about "PC-MASTERCONTROL"

    PC-MASTERCONTROL (PCMC) is an in-depth custom menu and file management
    system for hard drives.
    
    PCMC runs programs or DOS commands from menus, which you create, to
    help you stop fighting with your computer and become its friend.  The
    menu section lets you access your programs with a single key.  You no
    longer have to remember complex commands to run the many programs on
    your hard drive.  You create and name your own custom menus.  Then
    simply point to the menu you want and you're there -- without a
    tremendous headache!  The hard disk manager section lets you do all the
    complex DOS commands, and more, in a simple and easy-to-use
    format.  Set up this powerful package once and let it run your PC
    forever.
    
    Here are some of PCMC's features:
    
    ~ Exits memory when running a menu and returns when finished --
    freeing up memory for your programs
    
    ~ Extensive help keyed to each screen guides you through the
    program, as well as AutoHelp, a tutorial
    
    ~ Hundreds of command menus (macros) for the demanding user
    
    ~ Built-in editor to make menus (no fancy macro commands needed)
    
    ~ Built-in screen saver to avoid screen burn-in
    
    ~ Insert, delete or swap menus and macros with the press of a key
    
    ~ Set the colors of any screen
    
    ~ Check the total space and free space on any drive
    
    ~ Copy, erase or move one file, or hundreds of files at a time
    
    ~ Find any file on any drive with the global file finder
    
    ~ And much, much more!
