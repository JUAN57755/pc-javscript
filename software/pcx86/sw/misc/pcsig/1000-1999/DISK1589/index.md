## Information about "PC-PUNCH"

    Don't spend another dime on the most hated business machine in the
    office -- the time clock.  PC-PUNCH does a better job of keeping track
    of your employees, yet it doesn't break down, run out of ink, or offend
    those employees who don't like the idea of punching a clock.
    
    Your employees will spend no time learning the new system because it
    uses the same punch-in and punch-out concepts.  They may even find it
    easier since they won't have to locate their card on the crowded wall;
    PC-PUNCH keeps all information internally.  Imagine, there will be room
    for a nice picture where the time cards used to hang.
    
    Best of all, payroll becomes easier.  PC-PUNCH eliminates errors caused
    punching the wrong card or the wrong space.  It also calculates the time
    an employee works between the time they punch in and the time they punch
    out.  All that's left for you to do is add.  You set up the employees'
    records and, with password protection, only you have access to the
    records.  Never again will a time card turn up missing or mysteriously
    altered.
    
    If your employees work on computers, install PC-PUNCH at their desks and
    let them "punch in" when they sit down.  PC-PUNCH and your computer
    will do a better job than your time clock ever did.
