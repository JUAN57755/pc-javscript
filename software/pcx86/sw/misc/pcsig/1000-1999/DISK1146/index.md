## Information about "LOGIN"

    LOGIN restricts access to the computer by requiring each user to
    enter an authorized user name and password.
    
    A menu with up to 45 choices is then displayed from which each person
    can execute programs and DOS commands.  Users can temporarily exit the
    program to DOS, to do other functions.  If nothing is done by the user
    after a certain amount of time, LOGIN automatically logs off the user
    and blanks the computer screen.  Each time a user makes a selection,
    LOGIN asks whether it is for business or personal use and the user is
    allowed to make a short comment.  After the user is done and logs off,
    LOGIN records everything that was done into a special text file.  This
    text file lists the user's name, date and time of each action, menu
    choice that was selected, whether or not it was for business or personal
    use, and a short comment by the user.  LOGIN automatically creates
    separate monthly log files, according to the date entered when the
    computer boots up.
