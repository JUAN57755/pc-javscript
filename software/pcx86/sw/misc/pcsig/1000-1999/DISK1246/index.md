## Information about "BOWL - 101"

    At long last, some help for all of you overworked bowling league
    secretaries. Let BOWL-101 handle the drudgery of maintaining the
    records.
    
    Completely menu-driven, this was written with the novice PC user in
    mind.  BOWL-101 pairs teams for you.  Enter the three or four games for
    each bowler in the order they bowled, and it does the rest.
    
    BOWL-101 handles high team and individual games and series.  Scratch and
    handicapped, mixed or not, are done automatically.  Keeping individual
    averages for several weeks is no problem. Errors are easy to correct:
    any team, bowler, sub, high game, name, or score may be changed with
    just a few keystrokes.  It can handle 36 teams, 100 substitutes, 10
    bowlers/subs per team.  Auto lane assignments are totally configurable
    for match points, scratch, handicap, or mixed league in any combination.
    There are over 70 pop-up help screens, and easy edit features. Data can
    be sent to screen, printer or disk.
