## Information about "PC-CALC+ 3 OF 3 (ALSO 199, 1016)"

    If value means good product for the ``right'' price, then PC-CALC+ is
    outstanding value raised to the nth power.  You will find a multitude
    of capabilities in this power package that makes for an unbeatable
    spreadsheet combination.
    
    Math functions like absolute value, integer, modulo, natural log,
    round, sine, square root, true integer, 14 different trigonometric
    functions, and more are included.  8087/80287/80387 math coprocessors
    are automatically utilized if detected.  You will find all the basic
    and not-so-basic statistical functions included, such as average,
    weighted average, count, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, sum,
    linear regression, binomial distribution, normal distribution, and
    Poisson distribution.
    
    Data can be imported and exported from files from PC-File:dB, PC-File+,
    PC-Type/ASCII files, DIF, Lotus 1-2-3, and comma-delimited files.  You
    can also import blocks from other PC-Calc+ spreadsheets.  Printing
    options include printing entire spreadsheet or selected range, print to
    disk or printer, print sideways, use escape codes, pause between pages,
    and using single-, double- or triple-spacing.  You can save 25 macros
    per file to eliminate repetitive keystrokes.  PC-CALC+ spreadsheets can
    handle 256 columns and 8000 rows with 255 characters per cell.  After
    you're done with your number crunching, create bar and pie charts, or
    line and scatter diagrams.  Also, multiple variables can be graphed and
    accumulated.
    
    PC-CALC+ combines number-crunching power, graphing and flexible report
    options for an ideal spreadsheet.  PC-CALC+'s pop-up menus and context-
    sensitive help screens make it a pleasure to use.
