## Information about "COMPUTER SOLITAIRE"

    The government should put COMPUTER SOLITAIRE on its list of addictive
    substances.  The three games offer the compulsive obsessive card dealer
    all the variety and challenge you can handle.  SPIDER is a tricky deal,
    the nearest thing to a solitaire strategy and skill game.  Played with
    two decks, it's easy to learn but hard to master.  You'll recognize
    KLONDIKE, today's most popular solitaire game.  But you'll be taunted by
    three skill levels and a unique scoring system.  CANFIELD, a voice from
    Saratoga's past, will haunt you.  Originally, you bought a deck for $50
    and got $5 for every card played in the field.
