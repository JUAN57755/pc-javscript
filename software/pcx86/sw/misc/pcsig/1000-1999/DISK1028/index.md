## Information about "AVSCRIPTER"

    If you write scripts that require separate audio and video columns,
    AVScripter is for you.
    
    Unlike programs that graphically create two columns on your computer
    screen, AVScripter works with full-screen ASCII text files created with
    your word processor.  Working with the whole screen, you see more text
    on the screen at one time, you don't have to continually jump back and
    forth from one column to the other, and you don't have to worry about
    keeping the appropriate audio and video lines opposite each other.
    AVScripter does it all for you, automatically.
    
    Features include:
    
    ~ Sends two-column output--single-spaced, double-spaced, or
    single-spaced video/double-spaced audio--to your printer, your screen,
    or a disk file, automatically syncing audio and video lines
    
    ~ Allows variable-width audio and video columns
    
    ~ Automatically numbers and renumbers your scenes and pages
    
    ~ Looks for the best place to start each new page, then adds the
    appropriate "CONTINUED"s where necessary
    
    ~ Automatically centers your title lines
    
    ~ Prints a header line at the top of each page
    
    ~ Permits you to switch between full-width lines and two-column
    format within your script
    
    ~ Allows underlining anywhere, even in headers and title lines
    
    ~ Sends printer commands to your printer
    
    ~ Prints selected pages and multiple copies
    
    ~ Chains files for processing
    
    ~ Generates prompter/narrator scripts from the audio column.
