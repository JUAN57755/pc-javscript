## Information about "DCA CONVERSION FOR PC-WRITE"

    DCA CONVERSION climbs two mighty compatibility mountains and brings to
    the world of shareware solutions to problems IBM has long ignored.  The
    biggest involves a duo of programs that convert text on IBM mainframe
    environments from EBCDIC to microcomputer ASCII.  This allows mainframes
    to share files that were created with PC-Write.  Likewise, PC-Write
    files can be converted to EBCDIC for the most part and sent to
    mainframes.
    
    The same programs allow microcomputers using different wordprocessing
    programs to communicate.  DCA CONVERSION lets PC-Write transfer files
    between any program that will accept DCA files.  Many popular programs
    will accept DCA files including Ventura desktop publishing.
