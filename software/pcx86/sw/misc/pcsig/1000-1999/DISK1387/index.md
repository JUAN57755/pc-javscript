## Information about "NCAAPOOL & NFLPOOL"

    NCAAPOOL makes handling company pools for NCAA basketball a lot easier
    and less time consuming.  Normally there are several people who would
    like to know their statistics after each round of games is played, and
    doing this may take hours of work.  There is also the possibility of
    making a mistake in one of the records.
    
    NCAAPOOL solves all that.  All it needs are the first round team match-
    ups of the 64 basketball teams in the four divisions.  You then enter
    the names of the pool players, and the choices of their teams they
    think will win in each of the rounds of games, until the final winner is
    reached.  At any time afterwards you can enter the results of each round
    of the games, and immediately get a printout of the individual results
    for each pool player, showing which teams chosen won or lost.  A summary
    report, showing the total winning teams each player guessed correctly,
    can then be sent to the screen, printer, or both.
    
    NFLPool does everything NCAAPool does and does it just as well for your
    local NFL football pool.  It eliminates the long hours of handwork
    normally required to stay on top of the games.
