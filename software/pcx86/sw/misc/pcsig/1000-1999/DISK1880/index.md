## Information about "CONTACT  TRACKER"

    CONTACT TRACKER packs just about every function a small businessman or
    crack salesman needs to record every prospect or key person he meets.
    It stores those contacts in a crisp database and converts your computer
    to a neat phone dialer.  An arranger and organizer, CONTACT can maintain
    your calendar and schedule while prioritizing your chores.  It lets you
    sort those contacts in a variety of ways, write a letter, and then its
    mail merge function makes sure the letter gets out to the right people.
    
    You can set up CONTACT TRACKER to track important appointments, calls,
    meetings, dates, people and projects.  You can send out price updates to
    selected customers or memos to selected employes.  The program boasts it
    can churn out up to 60 letters in an hour and then print mailing labels.
    When needed, it will dial your telephone and let you make notes of your
    calls and store them with each contact file.
