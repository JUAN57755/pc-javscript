## Information about "CAPBUF"

    CAPBUF is a memory resident program that lets you capture any text
    screen and save it for later processing or printing.  It is quite useful
    for programs that do not otherwise provide means of printing their
    results.  Use it for intermediate results of games, or collecting copies
    of messages while on a bulletin board.  Remember that many elaborate
    program screens are line graphics.  They too can be captured then
    brought into an ASCII editor.  CAPBUF can be removed from memory once
    you are finished capturing screens.  A second program, Filter, can be
    used to eliminate extra lines or line drawing characters (especially
    useful if your printer does not support these characters).
