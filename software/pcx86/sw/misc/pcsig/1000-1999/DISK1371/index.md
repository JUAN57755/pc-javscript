## Information about "QUICKTRAN"

    QUICKTRAN is a telecommunications file-transfer program which
    compresses files as they are sent across phone lines, providing
    savings in time and money.
    
    In standard file transfer protocols (like Xmodem), the computer spends
    a great deal of time waiting to send or receive data.  QUICKTRAN puts
    this time to use, compressing and decompressing data as it comes in or
    goes out.  A comparison of QUICKTRAN to Xmodem demonstrated that
    QUICKTRAN is, on the average, almost twice as fast.
    
    The program is fully documented, easy to install and use.  A copy is
    required by both the sending and receiving computer.
