## Information about "C-A-S-E ACCOUNTING"

    C-A-S-E ACCOUNTING offers a system of accounting functions that meet the
    needs of most small to mid-sized businesses.
    
    C-A-S-E maintains three journals: the general journal and two
    subsidiary journals, sales and payroll. Sales are recorded in the sales
    journal because all sales transactions are basically similar. Payroll
    transactions are recorded in the payroll journal because that provides
    confidentiality, if desired. Also, both kinds of transactions generate
    large numbers of detailed transactions with low dollar amounts, such as
    sales tax and deductions, that clutter up the general journal when
    entered individually. Totals for these two subsidiary journals are
    entered into the general journal whenever desired, usually at fixed
    accounting intervals.
    
    C-A-S-E also maintains files detailing the transactions for cases or
    projects (using the name that you use in your business), for invoices
    and credit sales, for employee pay and deductions, for payables, and for
    capital equipment. Whenever a transaction is entered through any of
    these systems, the appropriate information is fed to the others that are
    affected and to the appropriate journal. This information is readily
    available, either on the screen or in printed reports.
    
    C-A-S-E produces both the standard accounting reports and the
    management reports that are most useful to knowledge firms: sales
    journal, by profit line and tax class, between any two dates; payroll
    journal, by employee by month, with deductions, between any two dates;
    general journal, between any two dates. Transactions in any general
    journal account between any two dates, with totals and balance. C-A-S-E
    financial histories that detail every transaction for a case, line item
    by line item. These use an easy-to-remember coding system that enables
    you to match billings against expenses and partner's time. The total
    expenses, billings, partner's time, disbursements from retainers, unpaid
    invoices and balance are also shown. Accounts receivable, by invoice.
    Accounts payable, by commitment and by firm.
    
    This is a straightforward and professional accounting program with every
    feature the small business will need.
