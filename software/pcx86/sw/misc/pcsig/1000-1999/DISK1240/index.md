## Information about "CUNNING FOOTBALL"

    You pick the plays, you run, you pass, you score!  It's CUNNING
    FOOTBALL -- a fast action game for mouse, keyboard, or joystick!
    
    CUNNING FOOTBALL provides the "Saturday" quarterback a chance to try
    all of his winning strategies on a realistic playing field that
    includes interceptions, penalties, and an opposing team that wants to
    stomp you into the ground.  On offense, you control the player with the
    ball.  After the snap, you control the QB until you pass, lateral, or
    hand the ball off.  On defense, you control the middle/inside
    linebacker. After selecting a play from the menu, you can display a
    diagram of the play to give you information about where you should move,
    who your available receivers are, and when you should pass.  Go team!
