## Information about "PC-CALIB"

    Chemists, researchers, and other users of analytical instruments will
    find PC-CALIB a multifaceted aid to the sometimes tedious task of
    instrument calibration or verification.
    
    PC-CALIB's curves can have up to eight points with three replicates
    each, and can be measured in any of 12 different standard units. They
    can be curve-fitted using linear, log-linear, linear-log, or log-log
    equations (log base 10) and either a first- or second-order polynomial
    least-squares fit. Experimental values or controls can be entered and
    checked against a generated curve.
    
    View the results on screen, print them, or format them as ASCII files
    for import into other software. Documentation for this menu-driven
    program is 40-plus well-written pages, and telephone support is
    available.
