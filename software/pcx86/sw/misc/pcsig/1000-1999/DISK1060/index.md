## Information about "PC-DRAFT II"

    A high-resolution, pixel-oriented utility for drawing and drafting.
    Built-in functions draw circles, lines and boxes; load and edit fonts;
    create bar, line and pie graphs; create patterns to fill areas; cut and
    paste objects; save objects to files for later use. Record graphic
    keyboard macros in files for playback and animation effects.
    
    Maximum resolution is 1280 by 700 dots, which covers several screens
    and fills an 8.5" x 11" paper at 150 dots-per-inch resolution.
    
    Capture screen images from other programs, save them in separate files
    and load them into PC-DRAFT II. Export portions of the screen, full
    screens, and/or full-sized drawings in GEM.IMG file format. Include
    graphics created with, or captured by, PC-DRAFT II directly into
    desktop publishing documents such as those created with Ventura
    Publisher.
