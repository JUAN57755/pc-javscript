## Information about "FISHBASE II"

    FISHBASE lets devoted fishermen, amateur and professional, keep track
    of their favorite fishing holes -- to catch more, bigger fish in the
    future.  It's a database diary in which you record all the important
    facts about the fish you catch, so you can return to the scene of your
    success.  It holds up to 1000 fishing trips.  In addition to location,
    you can record weather conditions, water temperature, size of fish
    caught, and which lures you used to catch them.  You can even note
    items such as the phase of the moon, in order to find out when the bass
    are likely to spawn.  You can also print many reports from your data.
    
    Currently in use by several ``pros,'' this program will also be of
    interest to fishing clubs for competitions.  The many help windows move
    the program along swimmingly, and they are backed up by a hefty user
    guide guaranteed to hook you.
