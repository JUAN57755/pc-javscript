## Information about "SLIDE MANAGER"

    SLIDE MANAGER organizes and catalogs your photographic slides or prints
    to make retrieval easy -- with special features for artists who
    photograph their paintings for submissions to competitions.
    
    For each slide or work of art, this specialized database stores the
    title, subject matter (12 categories), the medium (20 categories),
    dimensions of photo print or object, date created, ID number and special
    keywords.  An additional history of where and when the slide has been
    shown, sent, sold or given an award can also be recorded.
    
    The database allows you to search for a particular slide or group of
    slides by name, ID, or any of the other categories you've chosen.  It
    can also produce a printed catalog of your collection sorted in a
    variety of ways, such as by subject, alphabetically by title, etc.
