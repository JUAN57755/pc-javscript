## Information about "AZ REAL ESTATE FINANCE"

    Are you a real estate professional, broker, attorney, or investor who
    would like to do his or her own closings more quickly?  This program
    will allow you to generate most of the financial information needed for
    a standard real estate or loan closing as well as allow you to check the
    work of others.
    
    If you are a consumer who would like to better understand and check the
    work on those "TRUTH IN LENDING" documents you sign when you borrow
    money, this program will allow you to check your lender's work to the
    penny.
    
    It calculates annuity payments or periodic amortization of loans,
    interest rates on a given monthly amortization for a flat payout, or for
    a balloon payment.  It also displays and prints amortization schedules
    for payments to be made.
    
    This program has been "ported" from commercial software written by the
    author for attorneys, real estate brokers, title insurance companies,
    and other professionals dealing in real estate and real estate finance.
    This experience in the "real world" means that special attention is
    always given to accuracy and presentation.  The results are generally
    acceptable to law, real estate, and finance professionals.
