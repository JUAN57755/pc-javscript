## Information about "DATAMICRO'S PROPHET"

    LOTTO PROPHET has been completely redesigned, rewritten and expanded to
    become a very complete lottery software package. Point-and-shoot
    screens and well-documented programs make it nice to look at and easy to
    use. The best just got better. PROPHET is a lottery statistical
    compiler and forecaster.
    
    The program has four main parts:
    
    ~ Allows for file control, update, editing, and it sorts and prints the
    files showing repeat numbers
    
    ~ Produces statistical reports based on the most frequent numbers,
    current HOT numbers, numbers that have appeared the most with other
    numbers, and numbers that have appeared the most in a specific month.
    Prints prophet cards, graphs, trend charts, and more.
    
    ~ Stores numbers and checks for winners for up to three different
    lotteries at a time. Each lottery can have eight players, with up to
    six scores each. Prints a report on the players and their scores plus
    the results of the drawing--four out of six, etc. Great for groups of
    players.
    
    ~ Selects numbers for you with the Prophet's Prognosticator, if you
    prefer, and expresses an opinion of them. Works on all the state
    LOTTOS, Australian Gold and Canadian 6/49.
    
    LOTTO PROPHET can help you predict, store and check your numbers using
    the latest scientific methods or you can let the opinionated randomizer
    pick them for you. Good fun!
