## Information about "SPORT MANAGEMENT PACKAGE, DISK 2 OF 2"

    Go ahead and volunteer to be your kid's team manager or coach.  The work
    will be easy with this software package.  SPORTS MANAGER helps you
    manage any sports team -- Little League, Pop Warner, American Legion,
    etc.
    
    It consists of three modules.  The main module, TeamMgrM, contains
    information on players that is considered necessary for proper
    administration.  Module TeamMgrC is to be used by the manager or coach
    for maintaining running comments on the performance of the various
    players on his team.  Module TeamMgrD maintains information on the
    league and team required for day to day administration.  Three packages
    designed for maintaining statistical information on baseball/softball,
    football, or basketball teams and players are immediately available from
