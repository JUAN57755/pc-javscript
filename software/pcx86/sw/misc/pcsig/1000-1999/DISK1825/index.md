## Information about "IT'S A CRIME"

    It's the late 1990's in New York City.  You're a gang leader determined
    to build your gang into one of the richest, toughest and most notorious
    in the city on your way to becoming the Godfather.  Compete with up to
    500 other players, some of whom will be your enemies, while others will
    be your staunchest allies.  Each turn, you will decide how to allocate
    your resources, what moves you should make.  Mail your "turn card" with
    your moves.  A computer will then process your information and send you
    a "results" sheet.  It's your move!
