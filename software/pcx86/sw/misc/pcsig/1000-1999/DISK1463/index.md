## Information about "HP LASERJET SOFT FONTS & UTILITIES"

    SOFT FONTS AND UTILITIES is a boon to laser printer owners.  Imagine a
    great font downloader, handy utilities, and a wealth of incredibly
    useful soft fonts -- all in one package!
    
    For headlines, you get 21 point Broadway font with a Ventura width table
    and matching EGA screen font.  To complicate things, try a set of 24
    point symbols such as copyrights, bullets and circled numbers.
    
    Next, drop down to 10 or 12 point typefaces.  You get proportionally
    spaced Roman Times in bold, italic and medium.  Likewise, you get
    proportionally spaced Helvetica fonts in bold, italic and medium.  If
    that's not enough, try Garamond in medium, bold and italic.  For
    headlines try the 18 point Helvetica and Roman fonts.
    
    An elegant Century Legal is buttressed by an extended character set with
    a number of useful symbols.  It includes printer drivers for MS Word and
    WordPerfect.  The proportionally spaced Script soft font and the Greek
    font will give your documents variety.  Programmers can document
    routines with the font filled with keyboard characters.
    
    The download program is as elegant as the typefaces.  You can use it to
    download any HP compatible font.  If you prefer, it will assign an ID
    number of your choice and designate primary or secondary and permanent
    or temporary status for a font.  The utility can download directly from
    archived files.
    
    Print a sample sheet of any particular font -- a handy utility if you've
    come across a disk full of fonts.  Another utility will print out the
    sort of technical information on typefaces graphic artists delight in.
    A final program gives you information on LaserJet and DeskJet font
    formats.
