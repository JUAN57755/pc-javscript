## Information about "MISC. GAMES AND LOTTO"

    YES is the dice game Yahtzee for two players and has all the same rolls:
    full house, large straight, four of a kind, etc.  The program randomly
    generates the dice rolls and automatically keeps score for each player.
    
    RUN FOUR challenges two players to be the first to get four checkers in
    a row on a six-by-seven game board.  Each checker must be placed at the
    bottom of the board or stacked on top of one another.  A player wins by
    scoring four in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    RUN FOUR is supposed to have a different color for the checkers of each
    player, but on an EGA monitor both of the players' checkers are colored
    red.
    
    ROBIN plays exactly like Bingo.  Fun for parties, it prints up to 33
    different cards for players and then randomly generates callouts.  The
    player with the first winning card shouts, "ROBIN!"
    
    LOTTO MAGIC WHEELER helps you select and wheel numbers to bet in a six-
    number lotto game.  Wheeling is the technique of placing your numbers
    into combinations that guarantee a winning pick if any four of the six
    numbers are chosen.  Options offered: computer random pick, and
    wheeling 7 to 12 numbers into as many as 42 different combinations.
