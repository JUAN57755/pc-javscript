## Information about "PRINTER CONTROL PROGRAM - PRINTER TEST"

    PRINT CONTROL PROGRAM (PCP) is a time saver for busy computer users.
    Memory resident, it gives your PrtScr command all the power of your
    printer with a few keystrokes.
    
    Pop it up while running any other program.  PCP menus let you send
    control codes to the printer to select print modes.  Print any
    rectangular area of the screen.  Set margins on the printed page.  The
    printed image shows underlining, high intensity, reverse video and high
    order ASCII characters - whatever your printer can support.
    
    PCP lets you type anywhere on the screen.  You can use
    this to edit or annotate displays before printing.  The original screen
    is restored when you leave PCP.
    
    PCP is a handy way to enhance reports, make documentation more
    readable, or just to get access to the full capability of your
    printer.
    
    PRN-TEST provides for testing the complete instruction sets of
    Centronics 102A printers, standard Okidata printers, or any printer
    compatible with the IBM graphics printer.  Also, makes your printer show
    you ALL the possible characters it can print!
