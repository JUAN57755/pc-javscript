## Information about "UTILITY POTLUCK"

    Are you looking for a nifty little gimmick to customize your own
    shareware release or perhaps the disks you share with friends or members
    of your local users group? If so, get DISK SIGN.
    
    DISK SIGN is a simple, inexpensive package that lets you place a
    customized message of up to three lines in length into the DOS
    directory. The message is displayed each time someone uses the DIR
    command on the disk. The special title or business name is displayed in
    vertical columns and outlined in borders for emphasis. Operating this
    package is easy and uses very little memory. One of the more clever
    promotional or marketing ideas to come around in a while!
    
    Keep sensitive data protected with CIPHER -- a powerful encryption
    package that can turn any file into an unintelligible jumble of random
    characters. Only you have the key to unscramble it back into a readable
    form. Each encoding can have up to 50 printable characters. And,
    unlike most other file encryption schemes, CIPHER is very difficult to
    uncode because it's based on sophisticated techniques similar to those
    used by U.S. Government agencies.
    
    AUTONUM is a simple, useful program for assigning sequential numbers
    (seven digits max.) to such items as purchase orders, invoices,
    statements, checks, memos, and many other business forms. It works by
    using batch files to effectively automate the numbering process and
    reduce the possibility of repetitive errors.
    
    If you're tired of typing multiple keystrokes to execute common DOS
    commands, then MASTERDOS can relieve your keyboard-cramped fingers. DOS
    commands are reduced to single keystrokes making the overall
    operation of your DOS-based machine a breeze. Master configurations are
    stored as data files to eliminate re-entering of data. MASTERDOS has
    selectable terminal emulations and includes commands to copy files,
    change drives, erase files, locate files globally, reorder files
    on-screen, type files, and perform many other features.
    
    Learning MASTERDOS requires minimal training time, and on-line help is
    only a function key away. Six pages of well-written documentation
    cover the basics of operation.
