## Information about "WYS-AR"

    This accounts receivable program is based on a very simple concept,
    "What you see" in the data record windows is what you will get in your
    statements and reports. Being able to see the account records in
    scrolling record windows makes the program very easy to use. The
    program also uses many lookup tables to further enhance its ease of use.
    
    The concepts used in the program eliminate many extra steps needed in
    programs of this type. No journals to post. No periods to close. No
    loss of your existing charges by month end closeouts. No 30, 60, or 90
    day aged totals only. You decide the closing dates to print on your
    statements.
    
    This program is designed to keep all outstanding charges for visibility
    in record tables and for report purposes. The program offers virtually
    unlimited record capacities for maintaining large files if needed.
