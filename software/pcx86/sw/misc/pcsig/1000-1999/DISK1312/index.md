## Information about "CATALOG, SHUFLES, AND SETPRINT"

    Want to print on both sides of the paper?  You could figure out how your
    file will be printed, break it up and feed the parts to your printer one
    at a time (and hope that you didn't make an error) -- or -- you can use
    SHUFFLES, a computerized collator.
    
    SHUFFLES breaks your text file into chunks and rearranges them so your
    dot matrix, daisy wheel or laser printer can print on both sides of the
    paper without getting the page order messed up.
    File Descriptions:
    
    SHUF     DOC  User guide.
    SHUF     CTL  Tracks number of times the program runs.
    SHUFR    EXE  Main program.
    
    SETPRINT is a menu-driven printer-setting utility.  Used before printing
    a file, you can set pitch and weight, set a special printer mode such as
    underlining, or just reset the printer.  Commands can be embedded within
    the file to be printed to further change modes.  In addition, you may
    pause the printing for manual feeding.
    
    Build your disk library catalog simply and easily.
    
    CATALOG is a simple program that reads a disk volume label and
    directory and then formats the directory information into an ASCII
    file. This file can then be imported into your favorite database
    manager. It comes with sample file headers for use with PC-FILE+ to
    help you in designing your database.
