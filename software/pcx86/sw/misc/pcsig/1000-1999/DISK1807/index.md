## Information about "BOOK MEMO DISPLAY"

    BOOK MEMO DISPLAY takes any ASCII text file and turns it into a computer
    book.  Access any chapter, and any page in that chapter from the
    computer index.  No more scrolling through long documents to find the
    section you want.
    
    You provide the text file, this program converts it into a new file that
    is divided by chapters and pages.  It also creates an index display that
    lists these chapters.  When the index is displayed you can directly
    access any chapter with a single keystroke.  You can display successive
    pages within a chapter with another keystroke.  Move forward or backward
    through the pages, or go back to the index to change chapters.
    
    To make your own "book" you will need a wordprocessor that makes
    ASCII files (most do).
