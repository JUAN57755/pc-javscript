## Information about "MATCH-MAKER AND DOORS"

    If you need to find duplicate files on you hard disk then MATCH-MAKER
    is for you. It locates duplicate files across as many drives as you
    specify and, if you wish, MATCH-MAKER will delete them for you. This
    may yield more space on your hard disk.
    
    One unique feature of MATCH-MAKER is the use of match attributes. Files
    can be considered duplicates if they match on one or more of several
    attributes -- file name, file size, file's time, and file's date.
    Select the match attributes before starting the search for duplicate
    files. Once you designate the drive or drives of your choice,
    MATCH-MAKER will perform an exhaustive search of all directories and
    produce a list of duplicate files.
    
    MATCH-MAKER offers four distinct delete options. You can simply view
    (or print) the duplicate file list, selectively delete files from the
    list, delete one of the duplicate files or delete both of the duplicate
    files.
    
    MATCH-MAKER provides a disk storage option to free up RAM in the event
    that the list of duplicate files is too large. It also has a file
    tolerance feature which lets you match two files that differ by a couple
    of bytes in size.
    
    Let MATCH-MAKER do your hard disk housekeeping chores for you.
    
    MDTS is a database program for any church or non-profit
    organization to track members (mailing labels and telephone
    directories) and the pledges and actual donations by those
    members (member tax statements and internal analysis reports).
    It features numerous reports (A thru Z menu with some sub-menus),
    many of which (including mailing labels) permit user-defined
    selection criteria.  Has 99 user-defined donation categories
    (Christmas toy drive, Building Mtce, any name you define)
    and up to ONE BILLION transactions.  Bonus program (in a ZIP
    file) to extract data from any DBF file to an ASCII file.
