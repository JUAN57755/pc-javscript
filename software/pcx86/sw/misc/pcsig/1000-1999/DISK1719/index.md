## Information about "FIND-X"

    If you are looking for an easy way to catalog household goods, coins,
    photographs and slides, record albums and compact discs, computer
    programs, or some other collectible, FIND-X is the program for you.
    
    Designed with the computer novice in mind, FIND-X is relatively easy to
    install and use. Once installed, FIND-X is totally menu-driven and
    very little computer knowledge is required to add or retrieve
    information. However, you probably will be able to use the program
    more effectively if you have some familiarity with how dBase programs
    create and handle files.
    
    By taking advantage of the relational capabilities of the dBase
    language, FIND-X stores data in two small files rather than one large
    one, allowing it to find and retrieve information relatively quickly.
    The size of the catalogs is limited only by the available disk space.
    
    Conduct exact or generic searches. Exact searches retrieve only those
    files containing identical text strings. (Entering "flower" will not
    yield entries for which the descriptor is "flowers.")  Generic
    searches will yield all entries containing a descriptor beginning with
    the same text string as that specified by the use. (Entering "flow"
    will yield "flower," "flowers," "flowery," and "flowing.")
    
    FIND-X is a friendly program that creates and searches catalogs with
    agility. For the home user in search of a bit more order in today's
    domestic life, it is worth a look.
