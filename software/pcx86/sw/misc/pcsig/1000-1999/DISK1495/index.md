## Information about "ALICE IN WONDERLAND TEXT ADVENTURE"

    ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an adventure game based on Lewis Carroll's
    novel, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  Although you need not be
    familiar with the novel to play, there are occasionally places it would
    be helpful.
    
    In this narrative adventure, you type in dialogue and directions as you
    wander through Wonderland as Alice, gathering special objects and
    talking with the odd creatures and other characters from the novel.
    
    You will discover that your size can change in this game.  You start out
    your normal size and then may grow or shrink, depending on your
    actions.  At times, you will have to be very small to accomplish certain
    tasks.  But be aware that the larger you are, the better your chances of
    evading death.  Also, when you are very large, there is no weight
    restriction on what you can carry.  When you are tiny and you encounter
    a danger, your chances of survival are pretty slim.
    
    Winning consists of finding a particular valuable object and returning
    home with it.  Along the way, there are many adventures to be had and
    many places to see.  You will need to explore everything.  Suitable for
    ages 9 through adult.
