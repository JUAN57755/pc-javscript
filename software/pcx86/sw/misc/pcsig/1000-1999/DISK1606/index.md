## Information about "VERSA-SPOOL"

    VERSA-SPOOL brings a memory resident multi-printer spooler with big
    buffers and a bunch of options to the PC.  You get multiple buffers with
    adjustable output speeds.  If you're in a jam, you can redirect a
    printer output stream from one printer to another.  That lets you use
    two printers at once to print the same file, a bonus for people dealing
    with big database files.  It can also be a lifesaver for users who have
    a word processor whose output goes to a device other than the location
    of a letter quality printer.
    
    While useful to beginners, VERSA-SPOOL permits sophisticated adjustments
    and monitoring of its performance through command line arguments
    computer veterans are comfortable with.  It even allows the computer-
    wise to exploit memory locations beyond the 640k barrier that DOS was
    written to accommodate by specifying the location of RAM memory which
    VERSA-SPOOL will use for its buffers.  People with light programming
    experience can usually find between 64k and 192k of unused RAM lurking
    in a PC equipped with 640K RAM.
