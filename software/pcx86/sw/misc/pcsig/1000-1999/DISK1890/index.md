## Information about "TEST MANAGEMENT  DISK 1 OF 2"

    TMS stands for TEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, and the name is descriptive.  TMS
    is a software system, or system of programs, which automates many of the
    routine and tedious chores of administering multiple-choice and
    true/false tests.
    
    ~ Maintain a test bank of up to 999,999 questions.
    
    ~ Browse through the test bank and mark questions at will for inclusion
    in a test; you can let the program search for the questions by author,
    by the class or course from which it is derived, or by the topic or area
    of the questions.
    
    ~ Print the test directly on a printer, with a face sheet, a coded
    student answer sheet, and an overlay key template for correcting the
    student answer sheets.
    
    ~ Save a test in ASCII text form, to load into your favorite word
    processor for additional editing or special effects such as boldface or
    italics.
    
    ~ Print a reference key version of the test, which contains all the
    questions of the regular test, plus a graphic indication of the correct
    answer, the level of difficulty, area of the question, class, author and
    bibliographic citations.
    
    ~ Administer the test by computer, by placing the test on a single
    diskette; the test will be scored automatically, and if you choose, the
    program will show the student his/her score and even review the test,
    with the correct answers and the student answers shown.
    
    ~ For each test you administer by computer, print a report which
    contains the name and score of each person who took the test, and a
    tally of the distribution of answers for the test.
