## Information about "PARENTS HOME COMPANION: MANAGING COLIC"

    This installment from the multi-part PARENTS HOME COMPANION (PHC) series
    is based on managing colic problems in infants.  The PHC series provides
    parents and those responsible for childcare with expert assistance in a
    range of commonly-encountered problems.
    
    The need for documentation has been eliminated in the PHC series through
    the program's structure.  This is similar to the "expert systems" seen
    in artificial intelligence applications, in which you are guided from
    screen to screen by your answers to questions.
