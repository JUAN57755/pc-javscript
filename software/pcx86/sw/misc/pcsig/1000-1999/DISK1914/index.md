## Information about "DISKUTILITIES AND VDOS"

    VDOS is a visual DOS interface (shell) for power-users that prefer to
    work from a command line, yet want a directory display, quick-key DOS
    commands, previous command recall, and other shell features. It
    provides direct access to all standard DOS features, plus features not
    available in standard DOS. These include a paging file directory
    display that lists all files in alphabetical order and shows their file
    attributes as well as a visual directory tree for hard drive users.
    
    VDOS provides full command-line editing, and allows recall of the last
    18 commands for entry or editing. On-line help is provided for common
    DOS operations and frequently used commands can be entered by pressing
    one of the function keys. The VDOS interface is user friendly and
    always displays the current disk drive, directory, and DOS version.
    
    Disk utilites to easily copy and format disks.
    
    ~ QFORMAT -- Quickly format and verify disks in one or more drives.
    Supports 5 1/4 and 3 1/2, 180k, 360k, 720k, and 1.4meg drives.
    
    ~ QCOPY -- A very fast disk copy program which loads to disks in the
    sequence you specify, knows what formats to use and will do so from a
    command line or during the running of the program.
