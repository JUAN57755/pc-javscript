## Information about "PARTICLE SIMULATION"

    Here are several programs that simulate the orbits of celestial bodies
    and small particles. Use them to simulate the orbit of a three-star
    system, the orbit of a comet approaching the Earth, and the orbits of
    the Earth, sun, and moon. PARTICLE SIMULATION also has programs that
    simulate the movement of a particle inside an ellipse or an ellipsoid.
    In addition, there's an explanation of the twin paradox of relativity:
    why people should cease to age as they approached the speed of light.
    Graphics are included in the explanation.
