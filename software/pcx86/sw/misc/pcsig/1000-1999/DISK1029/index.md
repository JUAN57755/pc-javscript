## Information about "CC-SURVEYOR 2 OF 2 (ALSO 926)"

    CC-SURVEYOR is a geometric design program for civil engineers and land
    surveyors. It allows creation of point files with coordinates,
    elevations and descriptions, with import/export of points from/to most
    data collectors. It includes normal COGO routines plus radial stakeout,
    predetermined area, perpendicular and parallel offsets, topo reduction,
    vertical curves and grades, intersections, cul-de-sacs, and knuckles.
    Screen graphics include plotting of points, lines and curves, assigned
    to user-named layers with different linetypes and colors. Hard copy
    plotting may be done on Epson compatible dot matrix printers and
    on Hewlett-Packard or Houston Instrument pen plotters. Data may be
    transferred to CAD programs via DXF files.
