## Information about "THE WEATHER CHANNEL"

    Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything
    about it.  Well, now you can complain with authority!  THE WEATHER
    CHANNEL provides detailed information about temperature, rainfall, and
    atmospheric pressure, giving you a day-by-day listing of
    high, low and average statistics for date ranges you specify.  All you
    have to do is compile the data and enter it in an ASCII file
    according to THE WEATHER CHANNEL's specifications.  This simple
    program will do the rest, offering output to screen or printer.
    
    The program provides high, low, and average temperatures, atmospheric
    pressures, and rainfall for any year and city entered in the database.
    Sample databases and template provided.
