## Information about "THE PRICEBOOK 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1373)"

    THE PRICEBOOK acts as a centralized item pricing log so you and your
    employees can instantly know what you are paying for any of the hundreds
    to thousands of items you carry. It also generates price quotes,
    acknowledgements, purchase orders and invoices. Each of these forms
    will have the prices automatically entered, extended and totaled,
    eliminating manual data entry and math errors.
