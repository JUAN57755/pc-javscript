## Information about "FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS"

    FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS is a three-level menu-driven program for the amateur
    or professional photographer to aid in cataloging photographs.  Since
    the entire program is menu-driven, little experience or training is
    required to be proficient in its use.  Consequently the manual is rather
    brief.
    
    The first level, Basic, is recommended for minimal record-keeping.  You
    can store the most basic information about a photo, slide, or negative.
    But record-keeping is not restricted to these data.  For instance, you
    could (if you painted) store valuable data about your paintings or
    drawings.  The second level, Photographer, extends the information
    storage capability to include data such as processing and printing and
    any other data you might want to save.  The third level, Professional,
    adds on client information in addition to the above information.
    
    FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS allows you to create, edit, save, search, delete, and
    update any data files in the system.
