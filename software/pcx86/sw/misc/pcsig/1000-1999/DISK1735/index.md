## Information about "LOTTO BUSTER"

    If your dream has always been to strike it rich in the Lottery,
    maybe FreeBooter's LOTTO BUSTER can help you reach that goal.  An
    easy-to-use database program allows you to store your local
    Lotto drawings so you can track which numbers are hot and which
    numbers are not!  With a little bit of research -- the program works
    best when you can investigate at least the last 100 Lotto drawings --
    you may be able to turn the odds into your favor by examining the
    patterns in your Lotto series.
    
    An easy-to-follow setup menu configures the program to your particular
    system before you can begin -- after that it's up to you to enter the
    correct Lotto information.  Color screens (if available on your system)
    and pull down menus also add to the usability of this program.
    Different "types" of information can be viewed -- frequently picked
    numbers, less frequent numbers, and the "hot" sheet which selects the
    hottest numbers based upon the last twenty weeks of history.  You can
    also pick your own numbers to wheel.  Remember, without history, this
    program is valueless!
