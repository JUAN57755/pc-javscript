## Information about "FONE: INTERNATIONAL"

    If you are a home or small business computer user looking for a way to
    bring international telephone bills under control, you might be
    interested in FONE: INTERNATIONAL.  FONE comes in three versions, each
    on its own disk; one for business users, one for residential users, and
    a third for international callers.
    
    FONE will display the approximate prices for international calls to
    over 130 countries.  Several major telecommunication vendors are
    represented (AT&T, ITT, MCI, US SPRINT, etc.), including many
    services for each vendor.  For each query, FONE(tm) will display the
    point of origination, time, point of destination (several major cities
    in each country are in the international database), approximate call
    cost BEFORE IT IS PLACED, the vendor ID, effective date of the rates,
    call billing periods, and applicable times for the lowest rates.
    
    At the press of a button, FONE(tm) will track the price of an ongoing
    call in real time.  Several user options, using F-keys, are available,
    including adjustment of sample call times, volume discount calculation,
    the ability to temporarily exit to DOS while the timer is running, plus
    many other features.  A personal directory with notepad, for tracking
    contacts, is provided, and the user can get a printed report for each
    call displayed on the rate screen.
    
    The menu prompts can easily be used by someone with little computer
    experience, so the lack of a manual is not a problem.
