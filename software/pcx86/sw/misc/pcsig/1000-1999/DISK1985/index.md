## Information about "FCP ACCOUNTING"

    FCP ACCOUNTING is an easy to use accounting program designed to work
    similarly to the double entry method of accounting. All you have to do
    is enter your journal entries (which entails debiting one or more
    accounts and crediting one or more accounts), and everything else is
    done automatically.
    
    All journal entries are checked to make sure that they balance. After
    your journal entries are entered and posted, many reports are
    provided including: trial balance, income statement, balance
    sheet, capital statement, sales bar graphs, monthly balances line
    graphs with average line, YTD totals, to date monthly totals, and cash
    flow analysis.
