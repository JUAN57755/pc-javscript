## Information about "THE PROGRESS REPORT"

    Teachers, now the task of writing classroom progress reports is
    academic.  THE PROGRESS REPORT computerizes the process so that progress
    reports for five different classes, each with up to 50 students (250
    student total), can be generated and printed along with a summary list.
    THE PROGRESS REPORT is completely menu driven and intuitive to operate.
    You can enter up to 28 progress report comments, which are saved to a
    file, and can then be individually selected for inclusion in a student
    progress report. This greatly simplifies the job of writing progress
    reports.
    
    Each progress report consists of student name, comment number selections
    1 - 28 (you may select up to 24 of the 28 comments for any one progress
    report), test grade option, and an additional teacher comment.  The test
    grade option allows you to enter up to 8 test grades, which will appear
    in the report along with the average grade.  The last item in the
    progress report is an additional teacher comment for each individual
    student.  The progress reports are automatically printed along with a
    summary list of names for all students processed and their class or
    subject area.
