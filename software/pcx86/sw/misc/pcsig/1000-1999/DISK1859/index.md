## Information about "GARTHS SHAREWARE UTILITIES"

    GARTH'S SHAREWARE UTILITIES is a collection of utilities for copying
    disks, printing, and listing directories.
    
    COPYDISK is a multiple 360K disk copying program that makes several disk
    copies after reading the source disk only once.  If there are two floppy
    drives, you have the option to alternate between the two for writing
    onto the copy disks.
    
    D is a utility that allows you to change directories without having to
    look for the "\" key.
    
    DDIR is a date directory utility that lists files of a particular date,
    before a date, after a date, or in a particular date range.  Change the
    dates and times of specified files.  DDIR automatically searches every
    directory and can also be used as an ordinary file finder without the
    date options.
    
    PRINTER sends printer codes to the printer for changing the line spacing
    and the printing style.  The codes can be written to a file, which may
    be later used to set up the printer without the use of the program.
    
    DIRLABEL prints out a disk's entire directory in a small compact form.
    The program allows you to specify the drive, the printer port, the size
    of paper or label to be used, and the top and ending spaces for each
    label.
