## Information about "GUESS IT II"

    Game players beware, it's addictive.  If you like word or spelling
    games GUESS-IT may get you hooked.  Like hangman, you get several
    guesses to figure out all the letters in the mystery word.  In itself
    that might not sound too rough, but the 30,000 word list that comes
    with GUESS-IT  will challenge even the most developed vocabularies.
    
    As you make your guesses, the Guess-IT display keeps track of your
    progress.  The scoreboard displays how many guesses you are allowed and
    how many you have used.  The scoreboard also displays how many words or
    phrases you have tried and how many you have solved.  There's a
    "peanut gallery" that makes comments, and also asks you if you want to
    try another word.  You'll be kept abreast of the letters you have used
    and your progress with the current problem.  If you run out of guesses,
    the secret word will be displayed for you.
    
    GUESS-IT can be customized to use your own word or phrase lists.  By
    making your own lists, GUESS-IT becomes a great tutorial for any topic.
    Build a list of your favorite spelling words, great historical figures,
    important geographical points, or famous quotes.
