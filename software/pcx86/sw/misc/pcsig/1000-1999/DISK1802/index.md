## Information about "BALLISTIC"

    BALLISTIC is a program used to calculate bullet trajectories, remaining
    energy, velocities, etc., for small arms.  It will generate ballistic
    tables, calculate point blank range, and many other useful functions.
    Several may be plotted vs. range on systems with VGA, EGA, CGA, MCGA or
    Hercules graphics adapters.  A built-in database makes storage of
    personal data easy.
    
    The purpose of this program is NOT to teach the fundamentals of
    reloading small arms ammunition, but rather to aid the hobbyist in
    assessing the performance of the ammunition he has produced.  It is
    assumed from the outset that the user of this program is acquainted with
    basic reloading techniques.  For review, a list of references is
    supplied.
    
    This program is very thorough and complete.  The documentation is over
    35 pages long and extremely informative.  It discusses the variables
    considered in calculations, how they are to be derived, and why they are
    so important.  The appendix even has definitions on key words, making
    BALLISTIC a fine learning tool.
