## Information about "CAPACITY AND LOCKTITE PLUS"

    Upon execution CAPACITY displays free disk space in bytes and kilobytes,
    disk capacity, cluster size, and a horizontal bar graph display of the
    free space as percentage of the whole disk.  Helpful hardware
    information like the CPU speed, type of display adapter, I/O port
    detection including a mouse or joystick, installed memory, and DOS
    version is also displayed.
    
    LOCKTITE is a file and program protector that's easy to use and requires
    no special hardware.  Although your files or programs are locked, you
    can still copy them, transport them to home or office, where you can
    unlock the files and continue your work.
    
    Best of all, LOCKTITE works with any DOS file, whether it's an
    executable file, a document file or even a compacted file.  The program
    can read in your file or program, encrypt it using your password and
    then write it out to disk, along with a small header.  Your information
    is locked tight!
    
    Also offered is disaster insurance.  Should the awful happen and you
    forget your password, follow the instructions included and the author
    will unlock your program.
