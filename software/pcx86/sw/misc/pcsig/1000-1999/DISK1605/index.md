## Information about "DIRECTORY EXTENDED"

    Give yourself more power and freedom in managing your files operating
    totally from the DOS command line.
    
    DIRECTORY EXTENDED (DX) allows you to easily select one file or
    multiple files, including hidden and system files if desired, which you
    may then copy, move, delete, rename, compare or append with
    another file. You can change a file's attribute or its date, and check
    if a group of files can fit on a disk.
    
    Normal DOS files, as well as those within an archive (.ARC) file, can be
    directly sorted by name, extension, size, date, or file attributes. DX
    can perform a CRC or checksum test on your files to detect defects or
    alterations in files. DX commands can be incorporated into batch files.
