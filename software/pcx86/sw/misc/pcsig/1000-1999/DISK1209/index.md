## Information about "HDTEST"

    HDTEST performs a read/write test on your hard disk without disturbing
    the data currently on it!
    
    HDTEST writes 20 different test patterns to every cluster on the disk,
    checks that they can be read back correctly, and then carefully restores
    your original data!   Extremely sensitive, it can even detect errors
    which are minor enough to be corrected by the disk controller's own
    error-correcting code (ECC).  These errors are normally invisible to the
    user but may be the first signs of future disk problems.
    
    The program is also useful for automatic disk repair when you get
    intermittent or persistent read errors.  Because HDTEST tries harder
    than DOS alone, it can often recover almost unreadable data from
    both hard and floppy disks and rewrite it -- a real life saver when your
    backup fails you.
    
    Simple to use, the program was written to minimize the likelihood of
    user error causing data loss on a good disk.  HDCHEK, a companion
    program, gives you a quick compatibility report to tell you if HDTEST
    will run on your system.
