## Information about "MENU CONSTRUCTION SET 1 OF 2 (2119 ALSO)"

    This isn't merely another menu program, rather it is software that lets
    you construct customized and detailed menus.  With MCS, you can create
    extremely clean menus, with no unnecessary distractions on the screen.
    The menus are not memory resident, and therefore use no additional
    memory.
    
    Create attractive colorful menus with shadowing effects.  Your menu
    choice can run a batch file, display an informational screen you
    create, or display another menu.  MCS allows up to 100 items per
    menu and there's no limit on the number of menus in a given menu set.
    
    The edit/construct mode uses "1-2-3 like" commands to walk you through
    the process of creating your own menu design.  There are no
    documentation manuals with this program -- that's how easy it is to
    use!  Ideal for the system consultant or computer pro who needs to
    create a user friendly environment for computer neophytes.  Full
    mouse and LAN support is provided.
