## Information about "MOMSYS"

    Do you need to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, events, and other
    re-occuring activities?  MOMSYS is the ideal program for the individual,
    small business, or organization that needs to plan and track activities
    that occur on a regular basis.
    
    Activities can be tracked on a date of the month, such as birthdays or
    anniversaries, or on a day of the week for meetings, or on a weeks of
    the year frequency for activities that occur during specific weeks.
    
    MOMSYS is menu driven and consists of three components, a detail screen
    for entering/changing/deleting an activity, an inquiry system for
    locating activities quickly, and a reports function for daily or
    calendar reports.
