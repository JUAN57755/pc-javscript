## Information about "BASSTOUR"

    BASSTOUR is a fishing tournament game in which you captain a
    fully-rigged bass fishing boat.  You control where the boat goes and how
    it gets there.  Your bass boat has all the latest accessories, including
    a trolling motor, LCD chart recorder, a rod box containing six different
    fishing rods, and a fully-stocked tackle box.  The object of the game
    is to catch the heaviest five fish limit on each of three days of the
    tournament.  The fisherman with the highest total weight wins the
    tournament.  As in real fishing, it's not always easy!
    
    BASSTOUR has three levels of play: novice, intermediate and
    professional.  In any of the skill levels, you are fishing against 30 of
    the top names in bass tournament fishing.  You have six different bodies
    of water that you can fish.  The fishing area is drawn on the screen,
    and the program randomly decides where fish should be placed.  If you
    love to fish, you will love BASSTOUR.
