## Information about "B-CRYPT"

    A peace of mind program, B_CRYPT is a file encryption/decryption utility
    to protect your data files from unauthorized access.  Whether sensitive
    personnel files, confidential financial data, or super secret research
    information, this program prevents prying eyes from gaining access.  It
    will put the lock on any MS-DOS file structures including hidden files,
    no matter what the extension reads.
    
    You supply a password and it converts your data into an incomprehensible
    binary form based on a pseudorandom algorithm.  With a password from
    five to 32 characters in length, the chances of someone breaking the
    code file is greater than one to the 256^32.  And that assumes the
    hacker has a copy of B_CRYPT.  To complicate matters, you can encrypt a
    file more than once.
    
    With lots of documentation and screen help, the program is painless to
    use, and fast: a 17K hard disk file is processed in from 10 to 40
    seconds, depending on your PC's speed.  A RAMdisk further speeds up
    encryption and decryption.
    
    The author includes a challenge: break his encrypted message and
    win a cash prize!
