## Information about "PELTON COMPUTER CONSULTANTS"

    Here are five utility programs with five different purposes, but all
    helpful, easy to use, and well-documented.
    
    Given a starting balance, interest rate, term, and an ending balance
    (lower than the starting balance), DISTRIB will immediately calculate
    the amount of money that you may take out of your interest-bearing
    account (withdrawal amount) so that your money decreases to the ending
    balance over the term.
    
    FUTURE does the same problem but calculates the deposit amount when the
    ending balance you desire is higher than the starting balance.  Both of
    these equations can be tricky with interest bearing accounts.
    
    PAYMENTS is used to print range-and-spreads to the screen or to
    your printer.  You are asked for a starting interest rate which forms a
    spread in increments of 0.5 across the top, and you are asked for a
    starting value of another quantity which is spread in appropriate
    increments down the left column.  In between is a checkerboard of
    values around which your eye may peruse so that you may hone in on an
    interest rate that's best for you.
    
    The SED utility program is a "stream editor." You run the program with
    three qualifiers: the name of the file to be worked on, the old string,
    and the new string. The stream editor then transforms the old string
    into the new string without having to enter a wordprocessing program.
    The SED program works only with ASCII files.
    
    THINGS-TO-DO is a program to help you organize your lists of things to
    do, for example, lists of prospects, appointments, repairmen, phone
    numbers, action items for work projects, events leading up to a
    closing, lists of parts to buy for repairing your house or remodeling,
    grocery lists, lists of friends and their telephone numbers, party
    supplies, or any list limited only by your imagination.
