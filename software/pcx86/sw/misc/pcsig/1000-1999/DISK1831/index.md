## Information about "MORSOFT CALCULATOR"

    If you own a computer but still find yourself looking for a pocket
    calculator, look no further. Here's a full-function calculator for
    you.
    
    It may be used as an "adding machine" with the ability to sum up to
    1,000 values. Each value is stored in the computer memory "tape"
    which may be scrolled forward or back, changed, and printed. Both sub-
    and overall totals are retained and displayed on the screen, and the
    "tape" may contain multiple totals.
    
    Arithmetic and trigonometric functions are provided and calculation
    results may be added to, or subtracted from, the memory "tape."
    Values may be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to or from
    memory as they are entered. Enter and retain values in either decimal
    or hexadecimal number base. (All functions are available in either.)
    Try that on your pocket calculator!
