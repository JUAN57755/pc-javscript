## Information about "PRODUCTION CONTROL SCHEDULE"

    Captain Bly should've had this program for a first mate.  It keeps track
    of who is to do what and when, and prints out a daily work log for such
    activities as swabbing the decks and polishing the brass.
    
    SCHEDULER helps you supervise the daily activities of numerous
    individuals and departments working on a variety of projects.  The
    program remembers activities that recur daily, weekly, monthly, and
    quarterly.  It takes into account up to 36 holidays and generates to-do
    lists to start the day of each person and department.
    
    Your calendar is never carved in stone.  Change work days, alter holiday
    schedules or revise anything, and the global or specific changes are
    made automatically.
    
    You can adjust work weeks from one to seven days and tell it to skip
    days like the first of each month.  One activity can be set to trigger
    other activities.  Just tell SCHEDULER to set activities a variable
    number of days prior to or following some scheduled activity and watch
    it take care of the details.
    
    Its project planning ability helps prevent goofs.  If the stockholder
    meeting is set for the third of next month, tell SCHEDULER who has to do
    what and when.  First, it prints out a chronological checklist of all
    the activities that need to be done.  Then, day-by-day, it coughs up
    to-do lists insuring that everything that needs to be done, gets done!
    
    The fat on-disk user guide is crammed with useful information, but you
    may never need to consult it due to the simple-to-understand menus used
    to guide you along.
    
    SCHEDULER will help keep your organization shipshape and that may just
    lower the odds of employee mutiny!
