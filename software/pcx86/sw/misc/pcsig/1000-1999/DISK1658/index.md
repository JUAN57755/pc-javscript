## Information about "SCRIPTURE MEMORY"

    Your computer can help with Bible memorization, taking you
    step-by-step through the process of initial memorization and
    review. Through an exclusive arrangement with NavPress, SCRIPTURE
    MEMORY comes with 66 verses on-disk, organized under the
    Navigators' Topical Memory System. You can add as many verses
    as disk capacity allows.
    
    SCRIPTURE MEMORY uses the technique of associating topic, reference and
    verse to make it easy to memorize and retain what you have
    learned. The program uses two files to store both the verses you are
    currently memorizing and the ones you have already memorized. Each
    time you use the program, you will be working on the current
    review. In addition, SCRIPTURE MEMORY will choose from 5 to 40
    back-review verses for you to go over. Once you have built up a
    sufficient number of verses in your review file, the program will
    randomly select different verses each time it is used.
