## Information about "GOLF SOLITAIRE"

    Here is yet another outstanding solitaire game from United Innovations
    Plus.  GOLF SOLITAIRE is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
    The layout is made by dealing out five rows of seven cards each,
    overlapping face up.  A total of thirty-five cards form the layout.  One
    more card is dealt below the layout, face up to form your base.  The
    object is to clear away all the layout cards by building onto the base
    card.  Building is done in sequence, in either direction, regardless of
    suit, and if you make a wrong move your computer will certainly keep you
    honest.
    
    This top-notch software package comes with outstanding graphics plus all
    the features that make this a top-notch program.  You can control the
    speed of dealing and elect to view the shuffling of the cards.  You also
    choose the number of holes and which variation of the game you wish to
    play.  The graphics are impressive, clear and easy to follow.
