## Information about "SNAP FILER & MASTER MENU"

    SNAP FILER is a compact, memory-resident database program with many of
    the features of a built-in spreadsheet for use with jobs too small or
    short-term to require a slower, more complicated database.
    
    Organize data as a table or spreadsheet, with rows and columns
    displayed on-screen. Pull-down menus help make this program easy to
    operate. Keep track of names, addresses, sales, or anything else that
    can be kept in a list. Define and use dates, times, names, and dollar
    amounts for fields, with automatic proofing and formatting for each.
    Sort, search, and calculate the data in each file. SNAP FILER uses
    formula relationships in fields, with automatic recalculation after
    each entry. Print reports, either the current file or a certain block
    of data. Import and export files in .DIF format to other software
    packages such as Lotus 1-2-3.
    
    Create customized menus to be "control centers" for running
    application programs and frequently-used DOS routines.  For the novice,
    it saves a lot of frustration.  For the more experienced user, it saves
    a lot of time.
    
    You can run applications at the touch of a single key instead of typing
    in commands.  No more forgetting commands or DOS directory names -- all
    these are entered one time only and MENU MASTER remembers the commands
    for you.  It frees you from having to remember and type those
    complicated commands -- letting you concentrate on getting your work
    done.
    
    Major features include:
    
    ~  Menu settings entered directly from program -- no text editor needed
    
    ~ Ability to "chain" multiple menus together
    
    ~ 24 menu items with user-defined prompts, passwords and paths
    
    ~ Up to seven command lines per menu item
    
    ~ Custom screen colors and individual menu prompt colors
    
    ~ Personalized menu title with your own or company name
    
    ~ Custom on-screen user notes
    
    ~ Optional date and time display and clock chimes every hour
    
    ~ Menu screen blanks after three minutes to prevent screen burn-in
    
    ~ System password with extensive protection flexibility
