## Information about "CALENDAR PROGRAM AND TIKLER"

    Do you find yourself constantly flipping through a calendar to answer
    questions like, "How many days until . . .?" or "What was the number of
    days between this date and that?" or "How many days ago was this?" Or
    maybe you just want to have a yearly calendar, for any requested year,
    pop up on your screen.  CALENDAR PROGRAM is a quick, no nonsense way to
    help people whose lives are tied to dates.
    
    If you need to see a full year of monthly calendars, tell the computer
    which year and touch the return key.  If you have 90 days in which you
    must do something, tell CALENDAR PROGRAM the starting date.  After a few
    seconds, it will tell you the date the 90 days are up.  You can
    determine the number of days after a date, or before just as easily.
    Want to know how many days are between two dates?  Type in the two dates
    and presto.  CALENDAR PROGRAM works with dates for any year between 1901
    and 1999.
    
    Note that this program is not a scheduler, and is NOT intended to keep
    track of your appointments.
    
    If you are faced with the problem of organizing and remembering many
    appointments and dates, TIKLER will be of great assistance.
    This menu-driven scheduler generates full or partial print lists and
    also lets you view events, past, present, or future, on the screen.
    Four distinct delete options are provided.  You can delete all events
    prior to a certain date, selectively delete one event at a time, delete
    a single event, or delete all the events.
