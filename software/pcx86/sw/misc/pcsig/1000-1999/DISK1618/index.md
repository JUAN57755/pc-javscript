## Information about "STAT"

    STAT is a program that analyzes, plots and displays
    statistical data from internal data files or imported DBASE III and
    LOTUS 1-2-3 files.
    
    The data files created may have up to 800 records, 10 fields
    (variables) per record, and 10 characters for the name of each
    variable.  They can be viewed, edited, sorted, manipulated, and
    printed. The program can analyze the data and produce a number of
    graphs, including histograms, scatter plots, line plots, multi-line
    plots, X-Bar and R Charts, pareto charts and bar charts.  STAT can also
    calculate the mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, standard
    error of the mean, and more.
