## Information about "BIG THREE  DISK 2 OF 2 (1925 ALSO)"

    In this WWII strategy game you control all the action from the desolate
    fjords of Norway to the scorching sands of Egypt, from the strategic
    Rock of Gibraltar to the frozen streets of Moscow.  Recreate the epic
    and fiercely fought battles of Tobruk and Stalingrad.  Decide to open
    your second front in Normandy or the "soft underbelly" of Europe
    (Italy).  Build bombers to hit your opponent's cities or build tanks and
    fighters to encircle and destroy his armies at the front.
    
    Detailed maps done in excellent graphics help you track your progress
    and plan strategy.  Each player assumes supreme command of the Axis,
    Allied or Soviet forces in Europe during 1939-1945.  Players who
    perform better than their historical counterparts will normally win, and
    those who under-perform will normally lose.  Mouse and/or joystick(s)
    are recommended but not required.
