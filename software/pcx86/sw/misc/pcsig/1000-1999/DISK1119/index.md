## Information about "PULLED BY REQUEST OF AUTHOR"

    Many computer users are now worried about how they can protect
    themselves from the viruses and trojan horses that are out there -- just
    waiting to attack an unsuspecting system.
    
    Here's a disk full of programs to help you in that fight.  One of the
    programs lets you write-protect your hard disk before you try any new
    software, thus keeping viruses off it.
    
    FLUSHOT+ lets you write-protect entire classes of files, such as all
    your files ending with .EXE or .COM.  It also lets you check individual
    files for problems, keeps track of these files, and tells you if
    anything has changed when you check them a second time.  FLUSHOT+ even
    tells you when a program has inserted something into a memory-resident
    mode, thus alerting you to the kind of viruses that wait in memory
    before they strike.
    
    A second program, HDSENTRY, sets itself up in memory and monitors all
    commands sent to the hard drive of your system.  If the command is
    potentially harmful, such as attempting to write to the drive or to
    erase a file, HDSENTRY intercepts the command and prompts you for
    continuation.
