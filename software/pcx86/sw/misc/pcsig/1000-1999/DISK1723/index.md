## Information about "PC DATA CONTROLLER"

    If you are a moderately experienced user looking for a powerful
    and relatively easy-to-use flatfile database program, PCDC probably
    deserves your attention.
    
    The program incorporates many advanced features, including limited
    relational capabilities which permit data from two files to be joined
    in a third. PCDC also permits the creation of "Action Files" which
    execute macros created by recording keystrokes, allowing you to
    perform repetitive tasks automatically.
    
    PCDC is characterized by outstanding flexibility in the design of
    user's favorite word processor to generate elegant report forms.
