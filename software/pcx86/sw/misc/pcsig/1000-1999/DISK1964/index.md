    PC CRYPTOGRAMS gives you 50 of them in a program that takes all the
    disagreeable labor out of solving.  Type a guess anywhere the letter
    appears in the puzzle, and PC CRYPTOGRAMS makes the substitution
    throughout.  Change a letter anywhere, and the program makes the
    corrections throughout.
    
    PC CRYPTOGRAMS shows encrypted text and substitutions in the style of
    newspaper puzzles.  It shows letter frequencies at the top of the
