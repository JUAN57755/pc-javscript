## Information about "PC CRYPTOGRAM"

    NB BYDNSKMYFX AE E BIFTTLJMAJM NZPPTL MFXL!  Oh, excuse me -- you caught
    me talking cryptalk.  Baffling riddles of letters await the most ardent
    of cryptogram fans.  Cryptograms are the aristocrats of word puzzles.
    PC CRYPTOGRAMS gives you 50 of them in a program that takes all the
    disagreeable labor out of solving.  Type a guess anywhere the letter
    appears in the puzzle, and PC CRYPTOGRAMS makes the substitution
    throughout.  Change a letter anywhere, and the program makes the
    corrections throughout.
    
    PC CRYPTOGRAMS shows encrypted text and substitutions in the style of
    newspaper puzzles.  It shows letter frequencies at the top of the
    puzzle.  Function keys let you "SOLVE, "CLEAR," and "SAVE PARTIAL
    SOLUTIONS."  The puzzle texts are well chosen quotes from famous
    authors.
    
    PC CRYPTOGRAM will provide hours of challenging puzzle fun for young
    adults and older.  Improve word association and other skills.  A must
    for cryptogram lovers and a painless introduction for those who would

CRYPTOGRAM is a challenging puzzle game!  Baffling riddles of

quick action or graphics players, but a test for anyone who is

Easy to use, PC CRYPTOGRAM can be used on an IBM or Compatible.         
Just type in CRYPTO, select one of the 40 puzzles and begin.  Look      
for those common words and letters - this is the key to solving         
cryptograms.  PC CRYPTOGRAM provides you with a list of the             
"letters" used and the frequency in which you find them in the          
puzzle.  Once you think you have figured out a word or letter, just     
type it in under its corresponding "letter" and the program             
automatically fills it in to the puzzle.  A "Solve," "Clear," and       
"Save" feature are also included in this game.
