## Information about "BALLOON SPELLER"

    Your kindergarten or early elementary student will delight in these
    three happy games that teach spelling. Make 20-word lists of the words
    you want your child to learn and sit back while your PC turns into an
    infinitely patient tutor.
    
    In one game, the word flashes for an instant on the screen. The child
    pilots a balloon around the screen, picking up the correct letters to
    rebuild the word. If the child forgets the word, you can flash it again
    by pressing the space bar. The second game is like the first, except
    that each flashing of the word costs a point. In the last game, the
    letters are scattered about the screen and the game
    resembles Hangman.
