## Information about "SUP"

    Another little victory in the battle against copy protection. SUP
    removes copy protection from most Sierra On-Line games, such as the
    popular KING'S QUEST and SPACE QUEST. Now, you can have a backup or
    install the program on your hard disk. It works only with games called
    up from DOS and does not handle self-booting disks.
