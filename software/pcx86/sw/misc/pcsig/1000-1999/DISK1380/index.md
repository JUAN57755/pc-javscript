## Information about "RKS TASK MASTER"

    TASK MASTER helps you stay on top of all types of projects, assignments,
    tasks, schedules, correspondence, etc.  It allows you to set up a
    database with customized forms/records that represent your activities,
    such as individual tasks and schedules for a particular project.  Custom
    reports can be printed, including a list of all past-due assignments,
    all assignments for a particular project, which assignments are due for
    completion on a specific date, etc.
    
    TASK MASTER is completely menu-driven, using pull-down menus for
    selected options.  A pop-up calendar and calculator are also provided to
    help you build and edit your records/forms.  The program is compatible
    with standard dBase III+ database files and supports an unlimited number
    of records.
