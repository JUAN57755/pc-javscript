## Information about "TINY FONTS FOR HP LASER JET"

    As its name suggests TINY FONTS is a set of programs that generate very
    small character fonts for the HP LaserJet series II printers -- so small
    in fact, that you might need a magnifying glass to read them.
    
    There are two aptly named fonts, MYOPIA and FLYSPECK.  MYOPIA crams 128
    lines, with up to 200 characters each, on to one sheet of paper.  It
    saves you reams and reams of paper, excellent for those long text files
    that you have to print on a daily basis.  FLYSPECK outputs even smaller,
    188 lines with up to 260 characters each per page.
    
    In addition to dense printing of text files, these tiny fonts are
    suitable for labeling schematics and other technical diagrams.  C source
    code as well as tips on how to generate custom fonts are also included
    for those who want to experiment on the micro-small level.
