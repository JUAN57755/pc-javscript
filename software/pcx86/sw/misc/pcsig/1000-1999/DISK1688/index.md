## Information about "THE ASIAN CHALLENGE"

    Attention geography teachers -- teach your students about Asian
    geography in a text adventure setting.  Make learning exciting.
    
    The ASIAN CHALLENGE is an educational program, written for grades five
    through ten, which provides the student with information concerning the
    geography of the countries on the Asian continent.  It is to be used as
    a supplement to text books and other instructional material.  It uses
    the text adventure format to encourage the student to carefully read the
    information presented.  The text adventure format is an effective means
    for holding the student's attention for prolonged periods.  Learning
    becomes a fun experience and the student becomes much more interested in
    the study of geography.  The use of this program also increases the
    student's reading and spelling capabilities.
    
    This educational adventure is similar to a novel in which the student is
    the main character.  The students will visit most of the countries in
    Asia.  In each country they will be presented with important facts
    concerning the geographical features, early history, and animals native
    to the country.
