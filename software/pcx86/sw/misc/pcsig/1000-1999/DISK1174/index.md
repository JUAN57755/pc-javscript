## Information about "FOURSOME GENERATOR"

    FOURSOME GENERATOR automatically calculates foursomes (teams of four)
    for golf tournaments based upon their handicaps. The program allows you
    to keep a running roster of members eligible to play, including address,
    phone number, and handicap.  Information can be updated at any time.
    From the roster you mark those who are going to play in a tournament.
    FOURSOME GENERATOR generates foursomes so all teams will have an equal
    or almost equal handicap total.  Other options include:
    
    ~ Link players who want to play together while maintaining equal
    foursomes
    
    ~ Produce mixed foursomes (male and female pairing)
    
    ~ Up to 24 trial calculations (no repeats if same players
    participate week after week)
    
    ~ Generate low/high foursomes
    
    ~ Generate random foursomes
    
    ~ Players can be ranked in four different groupings
    
    ~ Tee times generated automatically
    
    ~ Sort roster on any field
    
    ~ Print address labels and print reports to printer, disk, or screen.
