## Information about "THE WINNING BID"

    I have a dollar, do I have two dollars? Two dollars, two dollars...
    sold!
    
    THE WINNING BID is a bonanza for both professionals and amateurs turning
    to auctions to raise big bucks. It lets you trace merchandise from
    donors or the house on through to the purchaser, reporting who receives
    what, and how much was the bid price. The 70-page manual tutors
    hobbyists on how to set up and operate this profitable fundraiser.
    
    THE WINNING BID records sellers or donors, and consigned merchandise,
    providing pre-sale receipts. Post-sale statements double as receipts
    for tax purposes and allow buyers to pick up merchandise. Merchandise
    lots are tagged with lot numbers, a description, and minimum bid if
    needed. Date, time and amount of sales are recorded along with the
    buyers' identities.
    
    The program prints paddle numbers in advance, and tracks buyers by
    paddle number and the merchandise they bought, and even adds sales tax
    where appropriate. It can combine lots, track bids made under the
    minimum and record seller alterations to bid prices after the sale is
    complete. Buyers can close and pay for their purchases at any time
    during the auction or after its completion. Likewise, sellers can be
    paid at any time or limited to payment when the purchasers of their
    merchandise pay.
