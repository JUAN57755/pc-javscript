## Information about "HEXCALIBUR"

    This powerful hex editor provides a full set of editing commands for use
    with any file, text or code, in either hex mode or in ASCII mode.
    Character insertion and deletion -- as well as overtyping -- are all
    supported.  In addition, both find and replace operations are supported
    in either ASCII or hex.  Block mode operations like move, copy, and
    delete are also supported.
    
    This hex editor stands out because it supports character insertion and
    deletion, as well as finding, replacing, and block mode operations, at
    the Hex level.  It is a RAM editor, so the file you wish to edit must
    fit into main memory.
    
    With HEXCALIBUR, you can: examine and change the contents of WordStar or
    other specially encoded files; filter incompatible codes out of files;
    convert Unix or BTOS text files (line terminator = 0a) to MS-DOS format
    (line terminator = 0d0a) or to MacIntosh format (line terminator = 0d),
    or vice versa; and much more.  HEXCALIBUR provides a convenient tool for
    making the kind of changes that, until now, were extremely difficult to
    do!
