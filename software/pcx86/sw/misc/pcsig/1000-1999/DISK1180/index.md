## Information about "PROPMAN 2 OF 3 (ALSO 1179, 1452)"

    PROPMAN will do property management accounting and record keeping for
    individual owners with up to 50 rental units.  These may be 50
    individual houses or one 50-unit building or any combination in between.
    Financial records are kept individually for each building.  PROPMAN is
    an on-line accounting system.  All data is updated throughout the system
    each time new information is entered.  Displays and reports are always
    current.  There are no transactions to post or trial balances to run.
    PROPMAN maintains monthly and year-to-date data about properties.
    Historical data is also kept about past tenants.
    
    PROPMAN does move-in and move-out prorates, calculates mortgage
    payments, schedules rent changes and can also print three-day notices
    and rent change notices.
    
    PROPMAN is completely menu-driven and has on-line help to guide you
    through its operation.
