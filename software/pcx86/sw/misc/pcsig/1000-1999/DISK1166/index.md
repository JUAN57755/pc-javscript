## Information about "POETRY GENERATOR"

    POETRY GENERATOR produces original poetry effortlessly: thousands of
    phrases, words, and several formats can be combined by random selection
    to form thousands of different poems.  After the poem has been created,
    you can save it.
    
    The program has a vocabulary of about 20,000 words.  The words are
    organized into short phrases and combined into poems of four to 12
    lines.  There is very little punctuation inserted, so you can punctuate
    in whatever way yields individual interpretation.  The poems do not
    always make sense, but such is sometimes the nature of poetry.  In any
    case, the original poetry created is entertaining.
