## Information about "FANTASY, GEMCAP, WHAT AND MORE"

    Create your own animated art and interesting designs with FANTASY.
    
    Paint flowing, colorful pictures or designs as you move the mouse or
    press the cursor keys.  As the images are created, the art is saved to a
    disk file so to replay on the screen whenever you want.
    
    GEMCAP is a memory-resident utility that helps you capture screen
    images from programs, save them in separate disk files and load them
    into other programs.  The disk files are compatible with any program
    that reads GEM.IMG files, regardless of whether the original screen was
    in text or graphics mode.  These include WordPerfect, Ventura Publisher,
    and many other popular programs.
    
    It's been three months since you used that file. You know it's in there
    somewhere, but where?  And what the heck did you name it? If you had
    used WHAT, you'd be able to find it quickly.
    
    If your filenames have lost their meaning, WHAT will make sense of them.
    This program maintains a listing of your files and directories and lets
    you attach descriptions of up to 61 characters for each. You then can
    use WHAT's search facility to locate that obscure file you know you
    have, somewhere....
    
    PROCESS simplifies access to many small programs using a point-and-shoot
    technique. It can be started from either the DOS command line or a batch
    file.
