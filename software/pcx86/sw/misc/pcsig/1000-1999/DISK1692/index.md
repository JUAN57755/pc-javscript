## Information about "BEGIN: A TACTICAL STARSHIP SIMULATION"

    This game is a battle simulation matching potential starship commanders
    against the computer.  The candidate can represent any one of four
    possible nations: the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, or Orion.  Several
    different ship classes with varying armament are available.  The
    simulation is complete including damage, casualty reports (from Dr.
    McCoy), engine temperatures (from Scotty), phaser recharging times
    (Chekov), and even the variables involved in navigating large as opposed
    to small ships (Sulu).  A player can command from one to a fleet of nine
    ships.
    
    The degree of difficulty is controlled by the size of the opposing
    fleets; a player can configure the odds in his favor or to the
    computer's advantage.  The computer strategy is quite effective; the
    novice captain probably will not win in a one-on-one confrontation.  The
    starship captain has a great deal of responsibility in a battle
    situation, and this simulation will truly test a candidate's ability to
    command.
