## Information about "THESAUR/THESAUR PLUS"

    Searching for the right word to say what you really mean?  This
    computerized thesaurus should help you become both more stylish and
    concise (make that succinct!) in all your writing and prepared speeches.
    
    Add panache to your letters, eloquence to your term papers, and a Phi
    Beta Kappa impact to your speaking endeavors by spending just few
    minutes with THESAUR.  When you call up a word, you are provided an
    array of synonyms and related words.  Set the pointer over your synonym
    of choice and you get a definition to confirm its aptness.
    
    There are over 10,000 main words and close to 50,000 synomyms in THESAUR
    The program also allows you to add your own words as synomyms, and even
    delete words that you think are inappropriate.
    
    THESAUR PLUS is a pop-up thesaurus, whenever you need a different word
    or a different shade of meaning than the word that comes to mind, pop-up
    THESAUR PLUS and get the word you wanted, but couldn't quite remember!
    
    THESAUR PLUS was designed with simplicity in mind.  You only need to
    remember your Hot-key (the key combination you use to pop THESAUR PLUS
    up over what you are doing now) to use the program!
    
    You can look up the word at your cursor, or call the thesaurus and type
    a word to reference.  With the registered version, if you don't like the
    synonyms THESAUR PLUS comes with, you can easily change them; allows
    full style editing with insert, overstrike, and delete.
