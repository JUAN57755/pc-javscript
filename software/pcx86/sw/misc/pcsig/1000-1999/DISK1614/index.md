## Information about "SKYCLOCK"

    A unique program, SKYCLOCK is an historical astronomical ephemeris and
    data conversion program. Unlike most other astronomical ephemeris
    programs, this program works with dates of both the Julian and Gregorian
    calendars and dates A.D. and B.C. SKYCLOCK can also calculate the
    positions of the visible astrological houses for a specific date. Thus
    SKYCLOCK can be used for both astronomical and astrological purposes.
    With SKYCLOCK you may also automatically convert dates between several
    calendars used at different times throughout history. On what day did
    Julius Caesar die according to the Roman calendar? With SKYCLOCK you
    can find out.
    
    As an astronomical ephemeris, SKYCLOCK allows you to calculate the
    positions of the sun, moon, planets, stars, comets, and astrological
    houses for any date back to several centuries B.C. You must first enter
    the date and time and the latitude and longitude of your desired
    observation point. You may optionally have the date and time
    automatically entered from DOS, and the time entered may be according to
    five different time standards. SKYCLOCK then lists all the time
    variable elements entered, and the position of the celestial body. For
    the planets, SKYCLOCK lists the heliocentric and geocentric longitude
    and latitude, its perihelion, the right ascension, the declination, the
    azimuth, the altitude, the phase angle, elongation from the sun, the
    distance to the sun, and the distance to the earth. Other specific
    information is included for the sun, moon, comets and stars. SKYCLOCK
    can also list summary information of the positions for the sun, moon,
    and all the planets for a specific date all at once. For calculating
    the positions of the visible astrological houses, you must also enter
    the longitude of mid-heaven, the geographical latitude, and the
    obliquity of the ecliptic. SKYCLOCK will then list the positions of the
    visible astrological houses according to nine different systems used
    throughout history.
    
    SKYCLOCK is not only an astronomical ephemeris, but also a calendar date
    conversion program. SKYCLOCK allows you to easily convert dates between
    nine different calendars used throughout history. These include the
    Julian, Gregorian, Egyptian, Alexandrian, Roman, Nabonassar, Islamic,
    French, and Zodiacal calendars. For converting dates between the
    calendars you may enter either the date or the Julian day number.
    SKYCLOCK will then list the Julian day number, the day of the week, the
    age of the moon, and the Roman indiction. You may also find the date of
    Easter Sunday and the date of lunar epact according to both Julian and
    Gregorian calendars.
