## Information about "GRAMARCY"

    GRAMARCY is a find-the-word-within-a-word game for children or adults.
    It has several thousand words, ranging in length from four to 11
    letters.
    
    You've seen this kind of game in the newspapers:  locate all the words
    hidden in a given word.  Each word given is randomly extracted from one
    of seven files in a word database.  You compete against the clock to
    find all the words you can.  Then you are scored for the number of
    correct words found versus the actual number of words hidden in the key
    word.
    
    GRAMARCY is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to hone his or her
    skills at finding patterns in letters.
