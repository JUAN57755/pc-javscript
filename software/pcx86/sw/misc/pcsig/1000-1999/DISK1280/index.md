## Information about "CARD GAME COLLECTION"

    Bring your own deck and cut!  Here's a lively collection of card games
    for your betting pleasure!
    
    Going to Vegas or Atlantic City?  Get in shape with Holdem Poker, the
    most popular card game in big casinos and card rooms across America.
    You play eight other players and start betting when you get two cards.
    The dealer displays three more cards which anyone can use.  After
    betting, two more cards are displayed.  This is a tough game and only
    the smart and the rugged survive.
    
    Accordion Solitaire brings the battle-weary a game for rainy Sunday
    afternoons when time is as unimportant as winning.  A gentle game with
    lots of instant gratification, it deals cards one by one.  If cards next
    to each other are of identical rank or suit, pile one atop the other.
    Likewise for those spaced three cards apart.  As the surf beats upon the
    shoals of Nirvana, you'll find your row of cards shrinking.  Using
    serene strategies, you might in this, or some future lifetime, get down
    to a single stack and win.
    
    Red Dog will delight any betting man or woman.  A computerized version
    of the old Acey Duecy game, it pits you against the house.
    Professionally drawn and swiftly moving, it deals a spread of two cards.
    Your goal: draw a card numerically between the spread of the two dealt
    cards.  You view a payoff table which tells you how much you will win if
    your draw is successful.  You can raise your bet once.
    
    Poker whizzes hone their betting skills on Poker Solitaire.  On the
    surface, it looks like a simple game.  Responding to cards dealt one at
    a time, you fill out a five card by five card square, trying to make the
    most points possible.  Runs, flushes and other poker hands are scored
    vertically and horizontally.  You compute your best odds in two
    directions at once as you decide where to place the next card.  The game
    moves fast; vibrant colors and designs enhance the screen.
