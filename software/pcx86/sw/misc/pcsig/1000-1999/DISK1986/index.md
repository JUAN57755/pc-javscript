## Information about "SPIRO"

    In the early 60's kids spent hours spinning out complex colorful spirals
    with the "Spirograph," a set of colored pens and plastic rings.  Now you
    can put the designs on your EGA screen and not have to scrub your hands
    afterwards.  Extremely simple to use, just choose three numbers and
    which color you would like to use.
    
    The registration fee is reasonable and makes this a pretty safe bet for
    anyone wishing to find some entertainment for their restless
    "artists" at home.
