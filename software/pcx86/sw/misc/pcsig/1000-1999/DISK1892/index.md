## Information about "RACE!"

    RACE! is a game of miniature car racing.  The cars can accelerate,
    decelerate, or turn through the race courses while many obstacles block
    their progress, including walls, slopes, gates, tornadoes, and gas
    slicks.  The more tracks a car successfully completes, the better the
    car becomes in areas such as acceleration, speed, traction, and
    helicopter speed.  Also, RACE! lets the user design his own race tracks
    on which the cars compete.
    
    This is a version of the old race program found in all the video
    arcades, and the quality is nearly as good.  You get an overhead view,
    looking down on track where you are racing other cars.  20 different
    tracks are included.  Great fun for kids, yet challenging for us older
    kids.
