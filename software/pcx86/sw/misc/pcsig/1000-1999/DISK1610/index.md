## Information about "SALES CALL REPORTS"

    SALES CALL REPORTS (SCR) enables a sales representative to easily and
    effectively use a computer to automate the reporting and customer list
    functions that are usually performed manually or not at all.  SCR will
    help sales reps organize and document their relationships with a
    customer, while helping a company keep records of what their sales reps
    are doing.  And all without ever actually filing reports.
    
    SCR becomes an effective central data source for customer status,
    contacts, specific sales notes, address information, and other
    pertinent data for every sale call.  Mailing labels, Rolodex cards, and
    sales reports are instantly available.  Paperwork is saved, and
    important customer contacts and personal notes won't be lost if a
    salesperson leaves the staff.  Best of all, the program is menu driven
    and so simple, even computerphobes will find it easy to use.
    
    SCR will increase the efficiency of your organization and provide
    better documentation on which to base business decisions.
