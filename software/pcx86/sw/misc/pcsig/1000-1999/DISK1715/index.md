## Information about "SPC-AR, TAKOFF, AND SPC-ESTIMATE"

    TAKOFF MINI ESTIMATOR was designed primarily for estimates and material
    take offs for general contractors. A master file of the cost of up to
    6000 items (materials and/or labor) is maintained and individual
    estimates can be printed out by combining these items. The menu system
    makes it easy to change stock prices and print new estimates. This
    program may be suitable for other professions which use items with
    established costs. The registered version allows the user to edit the
    reports as ASCII files.
    
    SC-ESTIMATE is a billing program for general contractors.  Separate
    entries are made for different types of work completed and the
    information is used to update an estimate.  The program allows you to
    enter costs and payments to date as jobs progress, and progress
    estimates can be printed as necessary.
    
    SPC-ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE handles the accounts receivable for a small
    business. Separate account numbers for each payee track the person's
    address, phone number and tax code. Enter a short comment and six line
    address labels will be printed for the records that you select.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Virtually unlimited accounts and records
    
    ~ Menu driven and very easy to use
    
    ~ Uses standard size paper to print statements
    
    ~ Generous sized descriptions for statements.
    
    The user may make charge or payment entries, record the date, a
    reference (such as an invoice number), a description and the type of
    payment. Reports include charges, payments, detailed account and summary
    reports, period reports, general statements and a Past Due Accounts
    report listing all outstanding balances of 30, 60 or 90 days. Records
    may be selected for interest charges on overdue payments.
