## Information about "DO-IT-YOURSELF LEGAL FORMS"

    If you need a help creating a standard will, revocable living trust, or
    durable power of attorney, here is a quick, easy, and inexpensive
    alternative to a lawyer.  Included are examples of common legal
    documents you can personalize for your own use.  All of the
    SoftForm files on this diskette are ASCII files.  They may be edited
    with a text editor or read into a wordprocessor.
    
    Forms include:
    
    ~ Copyright notice and registration form
    
    ~ Estate Summary Sheet; Family and Financial
    
    ~ Generic Last Will and Testament form
    
    ~ Living Will form
    
    ~ Simple checklist of administrator's duties
    
    ~ Durable Power of Attorney form
    
    ~ Revocable Living Trust forms
    
    ~ Revocation of a Revocable Living Trust
    
    ~ Irrevocable Trust Agreement.
    
    These forms were prepared according to current law and precedence.
    Nonetheless, laws vary with each state and change over time.  These
    forms are to help you prepare your own legal documents, not a substitute
    for a lawyer.
