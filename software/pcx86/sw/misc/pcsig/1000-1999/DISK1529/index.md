## Information about "ADA_TUTR"

    ADA-TUTR, the interactive ADA tutor, will teach you to be an excellent
    ADA programmer in minimum time.
    
    ADA is an ideal programming language because Ada programs tend to have
    fewer errors, to be easier to read, and to be much easier to modify
    later.  The U.S. Department of Defense mandated the use of ADA in
    mission-critical systems (DoD Directive 3405.2, 1987).
    
    Not just a "quiz," ADA-TUTR is a thorough course of interactive
    instruction that even checks "homework" assignments.  ADA-TUTR
    concentrates on teaching good program design, not just syntax, so that
    programs will take advantage of the features of ADA that make them more
    reliable and easier to maintain.  ADA-TUTR was written by John J. Herro,
    Ph.D., who taught a graduate course in Ada at the State University of
    New York at Binghamton, and taught ADA to employees of General Electric
    Co., Grumman Aerospace Corporation, and Harris Corporation.
    
    When ADA-TUTR is run on a PC, an ADA compiler is helpful, but not
    required.  A list of ADA compilers available for the PC is included.
    Since ADA-TUTR comes with ADA source code, it will run on other
    computers with ADA compilers -- even on mainframes.
