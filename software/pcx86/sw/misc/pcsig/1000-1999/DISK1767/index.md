## Information about "ZIPKEY"

    With ZIPKEY no one with a PC will ever again have to manually type in
    the name of a United States city or town (at least not one big enough to
    have its own zipcode).
    
    When run as an ordinary program, ZIPKEY allows you to instantly access
    any of the 43000+ zipcodes in the directory by searching by zipcode, by
    state-and-city, or by city-only.  But ZIPKEY is at its best when
    installed permanently in memory.  In this "memory-resident" mode, you
    can invoke ZIPKEY from within any other program (a wordprocessor, a
    database manager, etc.).  You can type just a 5-digit zipcode, and
    ZIPKEY will fool the program you're running into thinking that you have
    typed any or all of the following: the city name, the state name and/or
    abbreviation, the zipcode, and any other combination of fixed
    keystrokes.  This "keystroke output" can be in any format you wish.
    
    ZIPKEY is completely configurable.  You can specify any combination of
    keystrokes (the "hotkey") that will invoke ZIPKEY.  You can also
    specify
    alternate hotkeys to allow differing configurations of ZIPKEY to be
    available at the same time.
