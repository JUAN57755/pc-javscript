## Information about "DBSEARCH"

    DBSEARCH was written for people who inherit dBase III or compatible
    data files, but want an easier way to "get a handle" on their
    data. Edit dBase-type data files -- without dBase.
    
    Using dBSEARCH, do the following (and more) with dBase III data files:
    
    ~ "Point and shoot" loading of any file, any path.
    
    ~ Browse records in various view-styles.
    
    ~ Search for records using a template which can include up to
    seven fields and their ranges or values.
    
    ~ Sort files based on any three fields.
    
    ~ Print current status (filename, number of records, finds, etc).
    
    ~ Print records (some or all fields, indexed or not, finds-only or
    not).
    
    ~ Construct and print address labels (indexed or not, etc.)
    
    ~ Create a new database composed of fields from the original and
    containing records (indexed order or not, etc.).
    
    ~ Save current (filename, path) settings to disk.
    
    Load dBase III data files of any size. However, searching and
    indexing can only cover 32000 records at a time. Up to 128 fields can
    be displayed and selected. Memo fields (free-form dBase fields) are
    ignored by the program.
    
    The search template is convenient and intuitive, as well as extremely
    flexible. Data files are not modified by the program, ensuring that
    data is not destroyed.
