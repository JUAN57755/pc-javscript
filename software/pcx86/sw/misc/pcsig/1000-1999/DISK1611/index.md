## Information about "EZ-TREE"

    EZ-TREE is a genealogy program to track and report on family trees. You
    can keep track of up to 16 marriages per person and up to 32
    children per marriage.  There is no logical limit to the number of
    generations you can have for each family tree.  Each record contains
    first name, middle name, last name, maiden name, sex, birth date and
    information, death date and information, personal comments, marriage
    date and information, divorce date and information, and marriage and
    divorce notes.
    
    From the main menu you can retrieve an existing family tree, create a
    new family tree, work on the current family tree, delete the current
    family tree, save the current family tree, or modify the program's
    configuration, such as colors, disk directory, and screen blanking
    timeout.  You can easily add parents, spouse and children to the family
    tree.  For convenience, function keys are used to select family tree
    options, such as:  edit a record, find a specific record (person), zoom
    in on a particular person, etc.
    
    EZ-TREE will produce three different reports, which can be directed to
    the screen or the printer.  You can produce a report containing detailed
    information about a person, or a report on all people in a family tree,
    or a list of all descendants of a person.
