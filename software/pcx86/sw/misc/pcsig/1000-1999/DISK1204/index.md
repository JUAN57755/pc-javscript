## Information about "DLITE"

    DLITE brings powerful dBase III application tools to RAM memory,
    providing instant access to 10 powerful utilities. Applications
    "pop-up" at the press of a key while you are in another program.
    
    DLITE has a natural home in the busy office where a majority of the
    computer time is spent running accounting or word-processing programs
    but instant access to database files is needed for telephone queries.
    It's like having a multiuser program without buying the expensive
    hardware and software necessary. An expensive and comprehensive
    mailing list manager comes with the package. Edit, add, select,
    delete/undelete records or paste the data from any dBase III file into
    spreadsheets or text files. Indexes can be altered at will.
    
    DLITE includes three sample databases: the congressional directory, an
    index of PC Magazine articles for the last three years, and a mailing
    list manager.
