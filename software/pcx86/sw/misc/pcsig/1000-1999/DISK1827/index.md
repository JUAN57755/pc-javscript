## Information about "GOLF HANDICAPPER"

    GOLF HANDICAPPER is a combination golf score database and handicap
    calculator.  It can hold the most recent 20 scores of up to 1000
    players.  When a player enters a new score, the program automatically
    calculates his or her current handicap, their net score for this game,
    and their handicap for the next game.  The program can be used by an
    individual player, a team of players, or an entire golf club.
    
    The program is easy to figure out, even if you haven't used any type of
    database before.  The program is also complete, even taking into account
    the rating of your home course.
