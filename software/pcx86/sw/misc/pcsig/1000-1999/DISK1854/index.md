## Information about "LOANPMT"

    LOANPMT is a multi-functional loan calculation program.  Payments,
    principal, APR, and term of loan can all be calculated when given the
    other three.  Additional loan costs and loan points can optionally be
    added to the principal.  It is a good program for comparing different
    loans.
    
    Amortization tables can be printed, displayed, or saved to disk for all
    loans computed.  Early loan payoffs can be computed for existing loans.
    Loan information can be saved to or loaded from disk.
