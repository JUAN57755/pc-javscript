## Information about "JOB ORGANIZATION AND BACKUP SYSTEM"

    Power users take note!  JOB ORGANIZATION AND BACKUP SYSTEM (JOBS) is a
    powerful broad-based utility package for organizing and operating your
    system.  Simple enough for beginners, JOBS is menu-driven and best
    described as a computer ``housekeeper'', maintaining and organizing
    your system with an economy of keystrokes.
    
    Housekeeping tasks handled by JOBS include execution of application
    programs, backup or archiving of data from applications programs,
    installation and removal of programs and utilities, ability to
    customize frequently-performed operations, DOS shell functions, and a
    host of miscellaneous functions such as searching, sorting, comparing,
    backup/restore, etc.  An automatic installation sequence guides the
    user to proper program set-up procedures, and there are more than 50
    pages of thorough documentation.
