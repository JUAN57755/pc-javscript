## Information about "THE CHRISTMAS HELPER"

    Santa has helpers, so should you.  Turn your computer into a little elf
    with CHRISTMAS HELPER, a Christmas-specific database that helps you
    organize the holidays.  CHRISTMAS HELPER keeps your Christmas card list
    organized and alphabetized -- there is even a special category to help
    you remember children's names while you write greetings.  Of course it
    also provides for printing addresses on card envelopes or mailing
    labels.
    
    CHRISTMAS HELPER also organizes and edits your christmas gift list with
    gift ideas for your friends and family.  There is a place for last
    year's gift and ideas for the present year.  A similar list of your
    Christmas supplies, candles, stamps, wrapping paper, etc., is also
    maintained for your shopping convenience.
