## Information about "ELECTRON"

    Great for electrical engineers, technicians and hobbyists. ELECTRON
    helps solve electrical equations, performs various electronic and
    electrical calculations, and displays many different diagrams of
    motors, transformers, etc., on a graphic monitor. Electronic
    calculations are available for the D.C. Ohm's law, parallel resister,
    resonant frequencies, decibels, and resistance for ammeters.
    Electrical calculations are supplied for true power, watts, ohms, RPM,
    and frequency. Various tables, such as a standard wire size table, are
    also provided.
