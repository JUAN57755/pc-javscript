## Information about "TOMMY'S TREK"

    Go to a galaxy far, far away and battle the Klingon forces as you
    captain the new improved Starship Enterprise.  Use phasers and
    torpedoes, scan your enemies, lay space mines, put up your shields,
    navigate around your enemies and throw it into warp drive when the
    Klingon forces become too powerful.
    
    This game is loaded, so read the manual carefully before starting --
    learn how to use all the function keys (for the various moves) and your
    key pad to move your ship through the 8x8 galaxy grid.  Also
    important is the identification of the symbols -- you don't want to
    attack the local Starbase!  Travel through all 64 star systems as you
    rid the galaxy of the Klingons, and allow the Federation to bring peace
    throughout known space.
    
    Remember, the game will start on autopilot, so be ready to control the
    real-time simulation of the Enterprise before you start seeing attackers
    and hearing the sound effects.  Damage reports are flashed on the
    screens during attacks and an option menu is kept on the bottom of the
    screen to make your moves simpler.  The graphics are easier to
    distinguish on a color screen, but monochrome also works well.
    
    TOMMY'S TREK will bring hours of enjoyment to all who play.  Ages 10
    plus should take advantage of this smart package.  Make the galaxies
    safe for ages to come, using all the skills the Federation has taught
    you as a captain of a star ship.
