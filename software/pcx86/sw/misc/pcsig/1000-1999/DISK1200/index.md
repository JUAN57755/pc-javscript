## Information about "ANYWORD"

    ANYWORD is a text indexing and retrieval program consisting of two
    parts: Indexer which produces an index, and Finder which locates words
    in text.  Like a book index, your text is untouched.  All of the
    indexing information is put in a separate file, and your text files are
    not modified or rearranged in any way.  This means you can experiment
    with ANYWORD as much as you want without the worry of making an
    inadvertent change to your text files.
    
    You supply information about your files through the profile file, used
    by both Indexer and Finder.  Some ANYWORD features:
    
    ~ Searching by any word or combination of words
    
    ~ Display of selected text
    
    ~ Extraction of selected text into new files
    
    ~ Searching with simple Boolean logic, AND - OR - NOT
    
    ~ Searching with ``wild cards'', e.g., comput? for reference to
    computers, computing and so on
    
    ~ Exit to DOS and return without disturbing selected text or search
    results
    
    ~ Review of previous search results within a session
    
    ~ View of all the words that have been indexed
    
    ~ Automatic file location via the DOS PATH operation
    
    ANYWORD is useful for locating simple information or combinations of
    text.  It also extracts chunks of text into new files and allows
    browsing through a collection of files from any point within any file.
    You can page backward, forward, across files, to the beginning, to the
    end, etc.
