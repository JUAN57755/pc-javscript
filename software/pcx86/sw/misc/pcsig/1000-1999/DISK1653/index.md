## Information about "TURBO SCREDIT 1 OF 2 (2220 ALSO)"

    As a Turbo Pascal programmer you may enjoy screen design, but dread the
    hours of coding required to get the screen to look the way you want.
    Many screen library packages help, but still require that you write a
    considerable amount of code.  With TURBO SCREDIT, you create screens
    with the built-in screen editor; TURBO SCREDIT automatically generates
    the code.  No syntax errors and no repetitive debugging.
    
    The package mainstay is a special editor for designing screens. Tedious
    tasks such as programming in screen color, data field location, data
    field length, data entry order, and line and box drawing are easily
    manipulated in the screen editor.  Data input, conversion, and error
    checking are all controlled with a simple macro sub language.  No
    photographic memory or scratch work is necessary since the screen design
    is done as it would appear in the application. The generated code is
    even commented to make customization easier.
    
    TURBO SCREDIT can be used by programmers at any skill level.  It comes
    with extensive on-line help, a tutorial, and a programmers reference
    manual.
