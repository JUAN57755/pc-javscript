## Information about "WYNDSHELL"

    WYNDSHELL is a friendly, complete disk manager for users who fear the
    DOS prompt world. In addition to superior disk management, this
    menu-driven program can call programs or user-created macro commands
    (in lieu of batch files) with one keystroke, or mouse click. Never
    need to use the standard DOS prompt again.
    
    The WYND-DOS section of the WYNDSHELL program graphically displays disk
    and directory information. Using pull-down menus you can execute all
    DOS file and directory commands. But WYND-DOS doesn't stop here. There
    are commands to move files, re-sort the directory listing, print disk
    info, and more. A superior feature is the ability to "tag" multiple
    files for a file operation such as copy or delete, saving many repeated
    steps. All of these features can be run with minimal keyboard strokes,
    or even more easily with a mouse.
    
    The WYNDSHELL menu can be customized to directly call selected
    programs or execute a series of commands. A two-level menu is
    supported, letting you group programs by application. If you desire,
    WYNDSHELL pauses and prompts for parameters that the program may
    require. This is a feature many similar menu systems have left out.
    
    All of WYNDSHELL's commands and prompts are straight forward and easy
    to use. There is on-line help available throughout the program.
    
    WYNDSHELL adds the ability to include passwords for any menu item, the
    ability to select screen colors, and includes a screen-blanking routine
    when at the main menu.
