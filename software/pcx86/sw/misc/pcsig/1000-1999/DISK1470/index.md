## Information about "PC-CAI"

    PC-CAI is a computer language for the easy creation of computer-driven
    tutorials, tests or demo programs.
    
    Using the PC-CAI language, professional-looking graphics can be mixed
    with questions and text to produce a polished interactive program in
    minutes.  The PC-CAI language has commands for interpretation of
    answers, responses to anticipated wrong answers, limiting the number of
    answer attempts and more.  The graphics tools provided permit color
    selection and suitable screen manipulation, as well as the ability to
    create and animate images.
    
    PC-CAI provides a simple environment that even the computer neophyte can
    use to design helpful educational programs or games.  The system comes
    with on-line help and a built-in word processor to create programs --
    although any ASCII processor can be used.  There is even a PC-CAI
    generated tutorial on how to program with PC-CAI.
