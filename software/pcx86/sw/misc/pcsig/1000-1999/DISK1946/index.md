## Information about "MENU MASTER BY MORGENSEN"

    MENU MASTER was designed specifically with ease of use and simplicity in
    mind.  It can be set up or revised in just minutes, even if you have
    never used a hard drive before.
    
    MENU MASTER has a total of sixty entries available to you.  Thirty on
    the first menu and thirty on the second.  You may not need all of
    these,
    but it's nice to know you have the capacity.  MENU MASTER allows you to
    select either monochrome or color.
    
    MENU MASTER lets you view any entry that has already been set up.  In
    viewing you see the name that appears on the menu, the path to the
    subdirectory and the start-up command you entered at setup.  If you
    desire to move the positioning of the entry to another entry location,
    you can.
