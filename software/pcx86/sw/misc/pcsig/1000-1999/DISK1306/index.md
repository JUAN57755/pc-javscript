## Information about "GANTT CHARTING AND EXACCT"

    Keep track of that project, know where your resources are and how
    they've been committed.  Analyze your progress with a Gantt chart.
    
    Produce Gantt charts lengthwise on paper.  Plot up to 20 tasks with
    timespan ranges from 24 to 36 months.  If space allows, timespan
    increments can be in weeks.  The program is self-explanatory and checks
    extensively for invalid input.
    
    Monitor your finances and know where you are with EXACCT, a "no
    frills" aid to financial control.
    
    EXACCT records and keeps a running total of all your financial
    transactions and allows for flagging groups of transactions to perform
    various operations. EXACCT is functional, yet easy to use, and can be
    used for checking/savings/credit accounts, business income and expenses,
    and loan payments.
