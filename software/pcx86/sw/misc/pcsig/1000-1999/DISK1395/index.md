## Information about "PIANOMAN GOES BACH"

    PIANOMAN GOES BACH contains 12 musical selections by Johann Sebastian
    Bach: the first three two- and three-part inventions, Well Tempered
    Clavier (both preludes and fugues), and three suite movements.  All were
    transcribed and adapted for IBM-compatible PC using PIANOMAN (PC-SIG
    Disk #279).  The main menu offers the user many options in playing the
    12 works and is easy to use, even for beginners.
    
    The files are run from a menu as singles or in various sequences and
    provide approximately 30 minutes of Bach's work.  Each selection is a
    rich piece of music, even through a PC speaker.
