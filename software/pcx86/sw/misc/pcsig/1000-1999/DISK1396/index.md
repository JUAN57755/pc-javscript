## Information about "PIANOMAN DOES BEETHOVEN"

    PIANOMAN DOES BEETHOVEN is an exquisite translation of Ludwig van
    Beethoven's artistry for the IBM-PC and compatibles.  Five
    compositions,
    approximately 23 minutes of music, have been adapted by Nancy Moran with
    finesse and accuracy.  The music files were created using PIANOMAN and
    the author has included a detailed description of the advanced
    techniques she used in their transcription.
    
    Selections include: Moonlight Sonata, Minuet in G-Major, Six Variations
    on a Duet from the Opera La Molinara, Seven Variations on the
    National Song, and the Sonata Pathetique.
