## Information about "PC-DISK LABEL II"

    PC-DISK LABEL prints out disk labels for 3.5" and 5.25" disks and saves
    them for later reference or reprinting.
    
    PC-DISK LABEL (PCDL) is a simple program that can help organize a
    computer user's disk collection and, at the very least, make every disk
    label legible to the untrained eye. On each label, PCDL can print four
    lines of 22 characters and a fifth line of 74 characters in compressed
    mode. PCDL can even print multiple copies, invaluable for those who
    need to back up their hard disks often or the professional distributing
    software.
    
    Labels can be produced in three sizes for 3.5" disks and three sizes
    for 5.25" disks. A routine is included which prints labels to match 25
    stock label dimensions. PCDL is easy to use and works with IBM, Epson,
    Okidata, and Hewlett Packard printers.
