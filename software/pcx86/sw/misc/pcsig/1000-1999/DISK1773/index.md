## Information about "4DOS"

    4DOS is designed to make DOS more powerful and easier to use by
    replacing your COMMAND.COM file with a new command interpreter.  You'll
    find 4DOS provides a wide variety of capabilities that regular
    COMMAND.COM can't -- like an enhanced DIR command, point-and-shoot file
    selection for any command, or the ability to completely redefine your
    system's commands.  It provides enhancements to most of the DOS commands
    and introduces more than 40 new commands.  Yet 4DOS is fully compatible
    with COMMAND.COM.  You'll wonder how you ever got along with DOS alone.
    
    It is compatible with virtually all pc hardware and software, including
    most networks and most TSR (memory resident) programs.  It requires less
    than 3K of RAM while applications are running (less than COMMAND.COM).
    
    4DOS is a "DOS shell" but is unlike most DOS shells on the market.  It
    doesn't isolate you from the DOS command line; it makes you more
    productive while working at the command line.  If you're tired of the
    limitations of DOS, you'll love 4DOS.
