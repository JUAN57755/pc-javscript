## Information about "FILE PATCH"

    FILE PATCH is a utility program designed for use by computer
    consultants, technicians, information centers, software developers and
    those individuals who "tinker" with files. It provides the ability, at
    the byte level, for on-screen viewing, dumping to the printer,
    modifying, extracting or creating any data or program file up to 10
    megabytes in length.
    
    When displayed on the screen each character within a file is shown along
    with its corresponding ASCII or Hex value. The screen may be scrolled
    one line at a time up or down, may be paged a screen at a time, or
    repositioning may be performed at any point within the file. Also, the
    file may be scanned for a specific occurrence of a string of values and
    the file will be automatically repositioned at the point where the
    values are found.
    
    If a file is dumped to the printer all or only portions of the file
    contents may be printed and the values will be shown in either ASCII or
    HEX and optionally the corresponding characters may be displayed. The
    values in any file may be modified or new values appended to the end of
    the file in either character, ASCII or HEX. Any of the 256 ASCII or
    HEX values may be used. Values may not be inserted or deleted.
    All or portions of a file may be extracted to a new file or appended to
    the end of an existing file.
