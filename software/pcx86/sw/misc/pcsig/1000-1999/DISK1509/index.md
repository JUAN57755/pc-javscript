## Information about "ZYAC CALCULATOR"

    ZYAC will turn your IBM-PC or compatible into programmable scientific
    calculators.
    
    ZYAC performs all common arithmetic functions from addition and
    subtraction to exponentials, square roots and logarithms. Other
    features range from trigonometric functions, including hyperbolics in
    radians or degrees, to statistical functions such as mean, standard
    deviation, population variance, etc., and metric-to-English
    conversions.
    
    ZYAC uses the entire 80x25 computer screen, has online help and a menu.
    It's much easier to read and use than a normal hand-held
    calculator. Two memory registers and two programmable function keys,
    make it one of the most comprehensive calculator programs available.
