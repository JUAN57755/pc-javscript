## Information about "OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE AND BINGO"

    OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE takes the popular parlor game of solitaire
    and adds many new and interesting twists.  Starting with a standard
    deck of 52 playing cards, the program creates 4 stock piles (3
    cards down and 1 card up) and a base card which will be the key
    for starting the game.  The rest of the cards are stored in the
    "waste pile."  Each subsequent row can only be started by a
    matching base card of another suit.  The object is to build upon
    each base card the other twelve cards of its own suit.  Except for your
    starting stock row, you cannot play a card unless it can be
    found in the preceding row.  To add to the fun, the 4 stock piles must
    also be used in play.  The final outcome:  hopefully, all cards will be
    played!
    
    A great pastime for all who enjoy card games of any sort.
    Immediately accessible and easily understandable, OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE
    will soon be a popular game for your gaming library.  Don't pass
    up this wonderful package created by Raymond M. Buti.
    
    Being the BINGO caller can be a thankless job, so let the computer do
    it!  BINGO will print as many different bingo cards as are needed for
    your game, then pick and record the numbers for you.
    
    The program picks numbers between 1 and 75, one number at a time, giving
    the number plus its line letter designation, as in a regular bingo game.
    The program keeps track of the called numbers on a "tote board," to be
    available for comparison with the numbers on the winning card.
