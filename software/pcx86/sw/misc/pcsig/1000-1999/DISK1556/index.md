## Information about "LETTER SHIFT/TRIPLE OTHELLO"

    Puzzle people will be very happy with this one.  Imagine, if you will, a
    square made of 16 smaller squares, four to a side.  In each of these is
    placed one of the first fifteen letters of the alphabet, leaving one
    square empty.  You define how many times the computer will shuffle these
    letters.  Now, arrange them alphabetically while the computer counts
    your moves.  Sounds simple, doesn't it?
    
    TRIPLE OTHELLO is an interesting variation on the classic strategy board
    game.  Instead of playing one game against the computer, you play three
    games at once.
    
    The object of TRIPLE OTHELLO is to win more pieces than the computer.
    Winning pieces is accomplished by "outflanking."  "Outflanking" means
    you place your piece in such a way that you have your pieces on both
    sides (right and left, or above and below) of the computer's piece or
    pieces.  Whatever piece(s) you "outflank" become yours.
