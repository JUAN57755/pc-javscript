## Information about "SECURITY ANALYSIS & PORTFOLIO MANAGER"

    The serious investor with a portfolio will find a thoughtful pal in
    SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.  Developed by a financial
    consulting company, SAPM lets you enter your stock transactions
    quickly and easily.  Then it gives you all
    the reports you need to know what's going on with your portfolio.  A
    highly sophisticated securities analysis system is added, along with a
    number of tools to help you manage your money and deal with loans.
    
    The analysis of individual stocks uses principles developed by the
    National Association of Investors Corp.  Regression analysis is the
    primary tool to estimate future growth rates.  Reports include present
    value and book price, market value, current gain/loss, percent return,
    and percent of holdings a security represents.  SAPM creates
    amortization tables, calculates loan payoffs, determines future
    investment values, calculates current amount required for a desired
    amount (present value), calculates loan amortizations, and determines
    future value of regular additions to an investment plan (annuity).
