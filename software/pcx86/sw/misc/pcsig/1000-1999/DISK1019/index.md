## Information about "PC-PAYROLL 2 OF 2 (ALSO 565)"

    PC-PAYROLL is a complete, menu-driven payroll system for moderate-sized
    companies.
    
    It handles 80 employees on floppy-based systems and 200 employees on
    hard disk systems. PC-PAYROLL accepts hourly, salary, and tip wages, as
    well as bonuses and commissions. Federal, state and local taxes, FICA,
    pension and insurance withholding and user-defined deductions are
    automatically computed.
    
    Paychecks and stubs can be printed according to several predefined
    formats. A full range of reports are included: monthly, quarterly and
    year-to-date summaries, federal tax reports (W2, W3, 941), and a
    complete pay period detail. PC-PAYROLL is well organized, and has as
    complete a list of facilities as commercial payroll systems.
