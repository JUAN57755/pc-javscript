## Information about "LOWBALL POKER PROFESSIONAL"

    The game of Lowball Poker is played with a fifty-three card deck,
    consisting of a standard deck of playing cards with one joker.  This
    form of lowball is also known as California Lowball.  The rank of cards
    are from the king (high) to an ace (low).  The joker is wild and used as
    the lowest card in your hand so long as it doesn't make a pair.
    
    In Lowball, your goal is to beat your opponents by trying to get the
    lowest hand.  A complete reverse of what is normally played in high
    poker.  The best hand is a 5-4-3-2-A known as a wheel or bicycle.
    Straights and flushes do not count.  You watch your hand and the
    computer plays all the others.  Good graphics and complete control over
    shuffling, dealing speed, and display of cards help make this program
    enjoyable.
