## Information about "REMEMBER-IT"

    REMEMBER-IT is a multi-featured date/memory manager which ensures that
    important events, payments due, billings, birthdays, or (heaven forbid)
    anniversaries are not forgotten.
    
    Business associates, relatives, friends, and others will be impressed at
    how thoughtful and organized you are by remembering those important
    dates year after year; you need not give the credit to your computer.
    
    More than a calendar, REMEMBER-IT searches your list of events and, when
    the date is within your predetermined warning window, alerts you that
    the event is coming up.  Only events that are pertinent to a particular
    day's warning window are displayed.  You do not have to scan your
    calendar ahead for upcoming events.
    
    This program is not memory-resident but is designed to run every time
    your computer is powered up.  Events within the warning window will be
    displayed and you may continue on to other applications with one
    keypress or utilize several other program functions before exiting
    REMEMBER-IT.
    
    Program functions allow reminders to be entered based on annual,
    one-time, or monthly frequency.  Additional features include a calendar
    capable of displaying any month in a 200-year period, a date computer
    that will determine a date future or past from your given number of
    days, and a Julian day calculator.  Documentation is included.
