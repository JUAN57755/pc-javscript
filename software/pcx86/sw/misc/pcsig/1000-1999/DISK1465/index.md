## Information about "BRANDON'S LUNCHBOX"

    Primary colors and cheery music enhance the six programs in BRANDON'S
    LUNCHBOX that drill children, ages 3-7, in basics such as addition,
    number sequences, and letter matching.
    
    Your child can learn upper/lower case letter-matching and play games
    that train memory and teach problem solving. There are also games to
    teach counting and basic addition.
    
    Correct answers are rewarded with cartoon dancing bears, cheerful
    sounds, flashing colors and music. Parents should monitor their
    child's progress and are needed to help with some of the games.
