## Information about "TURBOMENU SYSTEM"

    The TURBOMENU SYSTEM toolbox is a set of routines designed for use in
    the Turbo Pascal language to define and manipulate pull-down menus.  The
    menus can be defined in a text or graphics mode in one or two
    dimensions.
    
    This system supports an auto-tracking feature that helps the programmer
    by keeping menu-tracking to a minimum.  It also comes with support for
    mouse-tracking.  The data structure used by the system uses stack and
    heap memory very efficiently.
    
    A sample program is included on the disk to demonstrate the type of
    menus that may be defined.  The toolbox supports versions 4.0, 5.0, and
    5.5 although this version is not object-oriented.  The program is
    written in Pascal and is available to registered users.
