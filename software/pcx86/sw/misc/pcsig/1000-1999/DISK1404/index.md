## Information about "TEXT/FILE HANDLING UTILITY"

    You've just finished the Great American Novel only to discover
    you've mispelled the name of a key historical figure.  You can ask for
    your old job back or you can use HUNTMOD!  Coming to your rescue,
    HUNTMOD searches out every mispelled name and replaces it with the
    correct one!
    
    Or have you forgotten in which file(s) you wrote about a particular
    subject, or placed a valuable snippet of data?  Let a companion program,
    HUNSTR, sniff them out.  This program looks for phrases or names
    you indicate (up to 10 at a time), and tirelessly searches through all
    your files.  When a match turns up, it records the names of specific
    file(s), and where in them it discovered which items of interest.
    
    Other utilities in this set are small improvements to the DOS commands
    DEL and TYPE.  QDEL deletes filenames listed on the command line from
    the specified directory or drive, but stops and queries first, ``Do you
    really want to do this?'' This gives you one last chance to avoid
    disaster.  FVIEW lets you read text files the same way as TYPE, but also
    lets you view a screen at a time, automatically, without having to play
    rapid fire with the CONTROL-S command.
