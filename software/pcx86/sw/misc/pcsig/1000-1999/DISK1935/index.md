## Information about "POPTEXT"

    This help-screen generation utility for Turbo Pascal and Assembly
    language programmers allows programmers to easily integrate pop-up style
    help windows into their own programs.
    
    POPTEXT features an easy to use editor, a unit to include in Turbo
    programs, and three bonus units, including some fast writing routines,
    routines to enhance CRT, and a unit with all of the key definitions.
    
    Each help window is a record consisting of 15 lines and 15 links.  The
    lines are displayed on the screen, and the links are hidden in the
    background.  In addition to being linked by line, windows are linked by
    the page up and page down keys.  Using the editor, you can create new
    files, and append the files up to 256 records each.
