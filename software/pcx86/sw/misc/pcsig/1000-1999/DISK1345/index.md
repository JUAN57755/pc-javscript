## Information about "SELECT-A-COLLEGE"

    SELECT-A-COLLEGE sorts through over 1000 accredited two-year and
    four-year colleges and universities based on criteria you select, and
    tells you the 25 schools that come closest to meeting your requirements.
    Factors you can select include: major field of study or degree, specific
    courses, maximum tuition, maximum room and board costs, desired
    geography, Masters or undergrad programs, and more.
    
    Processing takes around six minutes, and can save you hours of research.
    Includes an automatic letter-writing feature for contacting the schools
    to request further information and application materials.  Surprisingly,
    some of the best rated schools in the nation have some of the lowest
    tuitions.  Good news for parents!
