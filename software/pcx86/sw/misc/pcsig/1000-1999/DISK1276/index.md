## Information about "THE RECORD FINDER"

    Can't remember if you already have that album or cut of music?  Maybe
    you have too large a music collection -- or maybe you just need the help
    of THE RECORD FINDER!
    
    THE RECORD FINDER helps you organize your record or compact disk
    collection by building a database.  Record information is cataloged by
    record accession number, record title, performer, composer, composition
    title, subject heading, and record label number.  Menu-driven, THE
    RECORD FINDER supports basic edit and search functions.  Index lists of
    recordings and compositions can be printed when you go out shopping for
    more music!
