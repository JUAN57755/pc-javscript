## Information about "GEOMANCY"

    Want to know what your future holds? Try this computerized version of
    GEOMANCY, an ancient system of divination.
    
    Originating in Africa, GEOMANCY was officially outlawed by churchmen for
    its ties to the occult and witchcraft. For the daring computer buff, it
    offers a way to become a Querent and turn your questions over to four
    "Mothers," four "Daughters," four "Nephews," and two "Witnesses"
    in a dozen "Houses" with a "Reconciler" to resolve conflicts.
    
    You or your computer can create the needed 16 rows of dots found in a
    random field. Minutes later, you scroll through the dozen houses to see
    the truth revealed in ASCII interpretations. You can save your answers
    to disk, chart them, or print them.
