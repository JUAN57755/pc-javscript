## Information about "MSFORMS  2 OF 2 (ALSO 970)"

    MSFORMS and its utility program, NAMES, read a QUAN report from a
    Finnigan(tm) mass spectrometer and produce a finished report for given
    classes of target compound analysis (TCA), suitable for presentation to
    a client.
    
    Attach the RS232 communications cable that runs from the GC/MS NOVA
    computer to the Tektronix/Westward system terminal of the NOVA to the
    serial port of your PC. Load a suitable terminal emulator program in
    your PC and capture the Finnigan TCA QUAN reports as individual ASCII
    files.
    
    MSFORMS is then loaded and the QUAN filenames are passed to the
    program, along with other information, including matrix type and
    dilution factors. MSFORMS processes it and prints an analysis form
    suitable for delivery to a client.
