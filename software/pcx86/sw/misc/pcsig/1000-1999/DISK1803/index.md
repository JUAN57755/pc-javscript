## Information about "EZDOSS"

    It's a DOS shell that the novice will love for its menus and
    verification prompts. The experienced user will appreciate it for
    "quick key" command execution, "expert mode" to let the more
    experienced user work faster, and a unique operational design that
    provides faster disk access.
    
    One of the most annoying features of many DOS shells is each time a
    drive is selected, a time-consuming search for subdirectories takes
    place. With EZDOSS, this is greatly reduced by having the program
    create a disk file the first time it reads a hard disk. This disk file
    keeps track of where all the files are so when the drive is
    selected again, the disk file can be read faster without searching for
    subdirectories.
    
    The power of a DOS shell is realized through features like multiple
    file manipulation, precise "tagging" control by pattern, masking,
    viewing text files, and locating files in any subdirectory by name or
