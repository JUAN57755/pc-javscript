## Information about "CASINO SLOT MACHINES"

    Here are three slot machine simulations for the casino lover.  Besides a
    basic slot machine that matches dollar amounts three accross for your
    pay-off, there are also slot versions of keno and low-ball poker.  These
    games would be ideal for someone planning their own casino night.  While
    the ASCII graphics don't compare to the video slots you find in the
    casinos, the action is very much the same.  And if you play long enough
    you might find these slots are a little loose... but we all like a
    loose slot, don't we?
