## Information about "GAMES GALORE"

    Put your pedal to the metal!  BIG-RIG is a text game which puts you
    behind the wheel of an 18 wheeler long-haul truck, where you must face
    various conditions pertaining to the road, your rig, and the weather.
    To make your deadline and make more money, you can skip sleep, drive
    faster, or increase your payload at the risk of getting into an accident
    or paying a fine.  10-4, good buddy!
    
    GEMINI-2 is a tank war game which you may play against the computer's
