## Information about "USA BOX"

    Introduce the states of the U.S. and their geographic positions to your
    children.  USABOX helps little users learn to count by two while
    monitoring a target value. It also introduces the notion of vectors --
    the concept that a line has a value based on its direction and length.
    The four variations of USABOX stress similar skills, such as counting by
    five and choosing a destination state.
    
    USABOX is part of the Brandon's Lunchbox series of educational
    programs for 3-7 year olds. USABOX starts off with a package, a laser
    matter transmitter, a power requirement, and a destination state on a
    map of the United States.
    
    Your child must try to match the required power rating to transmit the
    package. You'll see the package load into the transmitter, hear the
    matter transmitter warming up, see and hear the laser beam transmit the
    package across the United States...eventually to appear in the
    destination state!
    
    The timing loops in the programs are based on the standard 4.7 Mhz PC
    processor. If you are using a faster machine, you may wish to run your
    machine in "slow" mode, or use a slowing program such as PC-SIG disk
    #1834.
