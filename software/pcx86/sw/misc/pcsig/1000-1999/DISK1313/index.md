## Information about "COMPUTER DARKROOM AND PRO LIBRARIAN"

    For those who develop their own pictures, calculating exposure times
    that are dependent on many factors can involve tedious (and expensive)
    guesswork.  COMPUTER DARKROOM calculates new settings for you quickly
    and accurately.
    
    Once you have one acceptable exposure with test prints, this program
    gives you the proper exposure times for any changes you decide to make
    in paper speed, contrast, magnification, or filter factors for all black
    and white prints, color prints, or color slides for f/stop values from
    f/2 to f/32.
    
    PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIAN is an information-retrieval system for storing
    citations of articles and books in your own library.
    
    Add, delete, edit, sort, and search citations in your database.  Each
    record includes the author, date, title, citation, number, four subject
    categories, and a short description.  A listing of the database can be
    output to the screen, a file, or the printer.
