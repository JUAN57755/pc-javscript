## Information about "PARASORT"

    PARASORT will copy, sort and merge your ASCII OR dBASE files easily and
    quickly.  Since most databases can export to ASCII, these files also can
    be sorted with PARASORT.  It can use complex record selection criteria,
    including record and byte position on input and/or output, to select
    which records it will sort and merge.  A special dBASE III interface
    enhances the program.
    
    PARASORT can display the fields of the selected files on the screen, one
    page at a time, 20 fields per page.  Specify which fields are key and
    in which sequence, and then choose the sorting order of each field.
    PARASORT can reformat the input file as it is read, skipping and
    limiting the input  and/or output records, including or excluding dBASE
    header records.  It will write the output records to one or more output
    files, formatting it as you wish.
    
    Sort on ascending, descending and absolute values of keys.  Convert
    fixed length records to variable length records and back again.
    PARASORT can eliminate duplicates or place them in an expected order,
    first, last, or don't care.
