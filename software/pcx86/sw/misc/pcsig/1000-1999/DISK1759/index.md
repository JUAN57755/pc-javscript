## Information about "MORSEMAN"

    This is your chance to get private lessons in Morse Code.  MORSEMAN is
    intended for amateurs, aspiring hams or anyone else who wishes to learn
    the International Morse Code or improve their performance and code
    speed.  MORSEMAN will take you through the procedure of learning the
    Morse Code (or CW as called by hams) and help you to increase your
    speed.
    
    You have the option of using MORSEMAN in teach or drill mode.  You can
    start with the easiest characters and work your way up to small groups,
    later going back to the ones that gave you trouble.  MORSEMAN is
    written with repetitiveness in mind, as the more often you hear the
    character and associate it with the sound, the easier it will be to
    recall it.
