## Information about "THE E88 TEXT EDITOR & NAMES"

    The E88 TEXT EDITOR (E88) is a powerful, fully-functional text and
    programming editor completely written in Assembly language.  It is both
    compact and extremely fast.
    
    Rather than using complicated keyboard commands such as those commonly
    used in other editors or wordprocessors, E88 primarily uses
    single-keystroke commands.  These make it more natural, logical, and
    easy to learn.  File control and set-up functions are handled in a
    menu-driven command window and informational prompts make operation
    easy.
    File Descriptions:

    NAMES makes unusual names for use by writers, game players, and just
    for fun!
    
    The unusual names are created by a scheme similar to a random number
    generator.  You specify how many names you want made.
    Names are stored in user-designated ASCII files at the rate of four
    names per line.  Since many of the names can't be pronounced or are
    unusual spellings, you need to select usable names from
    those created.
    However, the program is easy, quick, and inexpensive.  Even if only a
    few names in a hundred are usable, the seconds it takes to make them
    might prove this program helpful for certain users.
