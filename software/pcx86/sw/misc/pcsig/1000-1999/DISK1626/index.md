## Information about "YEAR PLANNER"

    YEAR PLANNER will help you and your staff organize your personal and
    business time month to month, or throughout the year. It lets you create
    your own wall planners which are laid out like the familiar "write-on,
    wipe-off" wall planner calender system. The system allows you to write
    deadlines and appointments and other important information in the "day
    blocks" of monthly calendars of your choice.
    
    The large standard calendar format lets you quickly update and erase
    appointments.  Moving from date to date takes only seconds. You can list
    your appointments by the hour, or use a special wrap-around feature to
    put major task descriptions and deadlines within each day block.
    
    An overlay template lets you enter similar messages in multiple day
    blocks.  You can even get an on-screen year summary to see the whole
    year at a glance.  The large calendar printouts already have major
    holidays built into each month.  Your own important dates may be stored
    in a file for automatic insertion into next year's file.
