## Information about "MULTI ASSISTANT"

    MULTI ASSISTANT wants to be your personal executive assistant, and keep
    track of the myriad of necessary details in your hectic life! This PC
    whiz kid takes care of your finances, calculates lending figures,
    manages your telephone and mailing lists, inventories your investments,
    and keeps your calendar.
    
    MULTI ASSISTANT prints checks for you, confirms checks/deposits (which
    it disburses into budget areas you select), finds and lists checks by
    category, and computes your account balance.
    
    Track your personal investments, compute their investment value, and
    pull them up to view by name or number. Maintain multiple investment
    files with multiple categories per file. Track your debits, compute
    loan interest, and display and print payment schedules.
    
    MULTI ASSISTANT acts as your personal secretary, maintaining telephone
    and mailing lists, and multiple directories. It can print addresses
    from your keyboard input or from list files, onto labels or directly
    onto envelopes -- even inserting the return address. It ensures that
    you will never forget another appointment or important project deadline,
    by keeping your calendar for you. It displays daily and weekly events
    or the events between any two dates you choose.
