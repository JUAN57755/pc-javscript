## Information about "PCHELP & UTILITIES  1 OF 2 (2026)"

    Imagine on-line help for DOS. This utility is a quick-and-easy
    reference guide to DOS commands, their uses and proper formats. When
    you need help, just type PCHELP plus the name of the command you are
    curious about. An explanation of the command and its proper usage come
    to the screen.
    
    Also included on this disk are some of the most popular DOS-like
    utilities. These routines do things that DOS should: WHERE will find
    files on your hard drive, RENDIR will rename a directory, LOCATE will
    find text in a file, DIRCOMP will compare two directories, and more.
    You can find similar files elsewhere in The PC-SIG Library, but these
    versions are supported by PCHELP -- you get an explanation and syntax
    help just like any other DOS command. You'll get helpful information
    without ever dragging out a DOS manual.
    
    PCHELP uses no overhead memory and won't get in the way of normal
    DOS
