## Information about "FRP GAME MASTER UTILITY"

    The FRP GAME MASTER UTILITY is set up to be generally compatible with
    Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and its many variants.  FRP is very
    flexible in its structure, and sacrifices some compatibility to maintain
    flexibility.
    
    FRP's utilities take the manual labor out of playing Dungeons and
    Dragons. Everything done with paper, pen, and dice can now be done with
    the keyboard. These utilities are compatible with Advanced Dungeons and
    Dragons.
    
    DICE ROLLING UTILITY -- critical hits, fumbles, double damage, D100,
    D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, any number of dice with modifiers, display
    monster information, roll monster hit points, and edit hit points.
    
    RANDOM ENCOUNTERS UTILITY -- generates random encounters for 10
    different areas, each with different probabilities.
    
    RANDOM TREASURE UTILITY -- treasure types A-Z, gem value, jewel value,
    edit, and view treasure data.
    
    GAME PARAMETER UTILITY -- lets you alter critical hit, fumble, double
    damage, and encounter probabilities.  The timer can be set, and combat
    die is selectable for special damage tables (except fumble).
