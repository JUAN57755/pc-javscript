## Information about "SAILSCOR"

    SAILSCOR is a very powerful and comprehensive sailboat race scoring
    program.  It's a quick and easy way to score sailboat races, print
    results and maintain seasonal standings.  It features automatic
    prompting of race results on a boat-by-boat basis, thereby eliminating
    the need to enter a boat's description more than once.  Ties are
    automatically broken using the standard tie breaking rules.  Multiple
    copies of the results are generated without a copier or running the
    program multiple times.
    
    Easy-to-use menus simplify each step, from the creation of a fleet, to
    the printing of individual race results, regatta results and seasonal
    standings.  This program also contains an extensive set of editing
    capabilities so that fleet information easily can be updated and
    corrected.  It uses the three standard methods of scoring races: the
    high point method, the low point method, and the olympic method.
