## Information about "CHURCH TREASURER"

    CHURCH TREASURER automates most of the heavy responsibilities of
    properly overseeing and managing the finances of a large church. It
    helps track your budget, income, and expenses listed under 500 budget
    categories of your choosing. Up to fifteen separate bank accounts are
    supported, including: checking, savings, and CDs. Balance your bank
    statements. You can even post to previous dates with an audit trail.
    
    Scores of standard and user-defined financial reports are provided to
    help you find exactly where funds are being expended. A handy utility
    allows you to translate budget item information into ASCII format for
    use with other programs such as your wordprocessor. This information
    can then be included in monthly church reports. A huge user manual is
    supplied on-disk along with an excellent tutorial.
