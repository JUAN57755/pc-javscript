## Information about "AUDIO II"

    AUDIO II prints nice-looking and easy-to-read label inserts to identify
    your personal recordings on audio cassettes.  The program is designed to
    help you organize your music collection, but can also be used to neatly
    label recordings of lectures, notes, sound clips, etc.
    
    Eliminated, from this point forward, is the tedious process of writing
    on the cassette inserts supplied with the blank audio cassettes.  All
    your recordings can now have custom printed inserts that make finding
    particular selections less of an eye strain, while bringing a
    professional look of quality to your entire collection.
    
    Each cassette insert has: two title lines (for names of artists or
    groups), head A/B (for the headings on the two sides of the insert),
    date A/B (the current date is used or you can change it), and songs (a
    list for each side of the cassette).
    
    AUDIO II is menu-driven with on-line help to answer your questions.
