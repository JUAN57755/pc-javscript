## Information about "CATALOGING SYSTEM FOR RECORD COLLECTORS"

    If you're a private collector, professional disc jockey, or radio
    station owner with a large record, CD, or audio tape collection, FOR
    RECORD COLLECTORS (FRC) gives a comprehensive searchable, sortable
    database for your collection.  In fact, FRC gives you three programs:
    The Collector, The Advanced Collector, and The Professional Librarian.
    
    Data fields include: song title, artist, label, producer, and up to 19
    other characteristics, such as run length and year produced.  FRC can
    handle up to 32,000 song titles per data file and an unlimited number of
    data files.  An additional security feature prevents unauthorized file
    access.
