## Information about "MAYAN CALANDER"

    Mesh the two ancient Mayan calendars with the Julian calendar and
    venture an understanding of your mystic horoscope on a level you have
    never suspected. Unto you can come the knowledge that on this date,
    warnings abound of the evils that lurk in the dark. Yet it may be a
    fine day for making war, love or money. Only the MAYAN calendar can
    bring you these arcane truths!
    
    The ancient Mayans used a complicated system of two calendars running
    parallel with each other. One, like ours, was a solar calendar, based
    on the 365-day year. The other was a 260-day astrological calendar.
    Together, they formed a 52-year cycle of named and numbered days and
    months, and were the basis of festivals, predictions, and religious
    practices. (Imagine the two calendars as big gear wheels with
    intermeshing cogs, one with 365 cogs, the other with 260. It takes 52
    years for a particular cog in one wheel to mesh again with a particular
    cog in the other, thus repeating the days in their original order.)
    Converting a modern calendar date to its Mayan equivalent requires
    complex calculations. This program performs the task quickly and even
    prints your Mayan horoscope! Not superstitious? Astronomers and
    anthropologists share great interest in the one solar calendar of 365
    days and the second 260-day astrological calendar. Harmonic
    convergences lurk where they mesh!
