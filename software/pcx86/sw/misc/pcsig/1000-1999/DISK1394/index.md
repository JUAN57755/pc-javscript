## Information about "READ MY DISK!"

    Anyone who works with ASCII-based databases, wordprocessors, or any
    program that stores its data in ASCII files will find this program
    useful. READ MY DISK! recovers ASCII data from a floppy or hard disk
    that has been severely damaged. This damage can be missing file
    allocation tables, missing directories, deleted files,
    magnetically-damaged disks and even disks with holes in them. In other
    words, if the disk will fit in your disk drive, then the damaged data
    can be recovered.
    
    When READ MY DISK! recovers data, it writes the data to an undamaged
    formatted disk. If needed, you can specify the size of the file in case
    you have a wordprocessor with limits on the size of the files it can
    handle. You can also specify if you would like high-order bit
    characters saved. This helps if you have damaged a file that was saved
    in a format used by WordStar or any other program that uses its own
    characters.
    
    READ MY DISK! works on all floppy and hard disks up to 32 megabytes in
    size.
