## Information about "DISK CATALOGING PROGRAM"

    After collecting numerous programs on your hard disk or several
    floppies, finding a particular program can be a tremendous, dreaded
    problem. DISK CATALOGING PROGRAM is a simple utility designed to handle
    just that. It creates a catalog of all your files by reading
    the information from your disks as you insert them in your floppy
    drive. Add or change the disk label as each disk is read by the
    program and catalog over 500 disks in one catalog. View and modify a
    list of disks. Search for a filename and the program tells you all the
    locations for that file. Add individual file descriptions once the disk
    is cataloged.
