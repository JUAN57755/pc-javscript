## Information about "RECONFIG BY OPTIMAL"

    For the beginner, RECONFIG demystifies the combination of AUTOEXEC.BAT
    and CONFIG.SYS -- two files which tell your computer what to do when you
    first turn it on (anything from setting your path to loading memory
    resident programs).
    
    A great tool for the hard disk user, RECONFIG lets you create and
    quickly change to a different DOS configuration.  Instead of grabbing
    your DOS manual when you need to swap printers or drop your programs
    from memory, you'll make the needed change in minutes.  You can maintain
    multiple sets of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, quickly
    transforming your DOS machine to a whole new environment.
    
    The program can maintain a database of up to 100 different
    configurations with its built-in editor and easy-to-use drop down menus.
