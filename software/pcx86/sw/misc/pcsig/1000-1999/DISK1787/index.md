## Information about "THE GUARDIAN"

    THE GUARDIAN is a security system designed to protect an entire disk
    (either a hard disk or a floppy disk) against unauthorized use.  THE
    GUARDIAN uses an algorithm that logically "locks" a disk so that NO
    files, programs, or directories on the disk may be accessed.  This can
    be an added security to files that may already be encrypted or password
    protected.
    
    Many security programs load themselves from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Such
    programs are easily skirted with a floppy boot.  THE GUARDIAN keeps
    disks locked tight until the "unlock" program is run.
    
    When a disk is locked by THE GUARDIAN, the files on that disk are not
    physically altered.  Rather, what is altered is the information that
    tells DOS where those files are.  An anti-virus file check is also built
    into the system.  Under no circumstances should this program be used
    before reading the instruction manual!
