## Information about "EASYTYPE"

    EASYTYPE is the first and only typesetting program which directly
    translates wordprocessing files into the format of most typesetting
    systems, and some desktop publishing systems.  In addition to a
    generic/ASCII mode which handles the standard ASCII files that are
    produced by most wordprocessors, EASYTYPE also offers special modes
    which directly translate codes unique to wordprocessing files created by
    industry leading WordPerfect and WordStar.  With EASYTYPE, anyone
    familiar with wordprocessing can prepare basic typesetting files.
    
    EASYTYPE is an intelligent translation program.  Other programs
    translate wordprocessing files simply by removing characters which
    might confuse the typesetting program.  They also turn all line endings
    into "hard" returns which must be individually removed by the
    typesetter.  EASYTYPE is smart enough to truly translate word processing
    codes to typesetting codes.  One-key macros are also supported by
    EASYTYPE, so unique file translations are easy to perform.
