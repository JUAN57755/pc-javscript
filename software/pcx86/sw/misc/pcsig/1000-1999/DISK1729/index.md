## Information about "FONE: BUSINESS"

    If you are a small business or home computer user looking for a way to
    bring long distance telephone bills under control, FONE(tm) BUSINESS can
    help you reduce and track telecommunications costs.  FONE(tm) is a
    mature telephone call pricing database program for point-to-point,
    voice, FAX, E-mail, and BBS calls.
    
    FONE(tm) will display the approximate prices for national interstate
    long distance calls.  Several major business telecommunication vendors
    are represented (AT&T, ITT, MCI, US SPRINT, etc.), including many
    services for each vendor.  For each query, FONE(tm) will display the
    point of origination, time, point of destination (over 1200 cities are
    in the national database), approximate call BEFORE IT IS PLACED, the
    vendor ID, effective date of the rates, call billing periods, and
    applicable times for the lowest rates.  At the press of a button,
    FONE(tm) will track the price of an ongoing call in real time.
    
    Several user options, using F-keys, are available, including adjustment
    of sample call times, volume discount calculation, the ability to
    temporarily exit to DOS while the timer is running, plus many other
    features.  A personal directory with notepad, for tracking contacts, is
    provided, and the user can get a printed report for each call displayed
    on the rate screen.
    
    FONE(tm) is very easy to use, features hot menus, and an extensive help
    facility.
