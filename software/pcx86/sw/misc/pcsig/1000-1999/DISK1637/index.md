## Information about "WINDOW MENU"

    WINDOW MENU is an advanced menu program with state-of-the-art screen
    windowing.  This sophisticated program will organize your computer
    system.  For the user with networking or a high performance PC, plus a
    color monitor and a mouse, WINDOW MENU delivers its fullest control
    over files and programs.  It even includes features DOS lacks, such as
    automated backup and restore.
    
    With WINDOW MENU, you see menus as you build them, including titles,
    options, selections and colors.  In fact, you create the full program
    without ever leaving WINDOW MENU.  Complete mouse support is built in
    with an actual mouse cursor and point and click capability, not just
    emulated keystrokes.  You can have up to 105 menu selections
    categorized
    under as many as seven window titles across the menu bar.  You can chain
    to other menus, allowing an unlimited number of menu options.
    
    Menu selections can be assigned their own immediate execution keys for
    one-key access from any point in your personalized menu.  Any
    character from the menu selections can act as a hot key, not just the
    first character of the selection name.
    
    Each menu option can prompt for up to four parameters to be passed on to
    applications.  You get password protection for every menu option,
    including exiting to DOS, menu modifying and displaying new menus.
    WINDOW MENU provides a help text window for each menu selection so you
    can enter your own descriptions.  And, because it supports networks,
    multiple systems can share the same WINDOW MENU files.
    
    WINDOW MENU contains context sensitive on-screen help at the touch of a
    single key.
