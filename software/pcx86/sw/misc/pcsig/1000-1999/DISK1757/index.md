## Information about "PC-DRAFT-CAD"

    PC-DRAFT-CAD is an object-oriented CAD program for drawing or drafting
    on a PC. PCD-CAD is different from most drawing packages because it
    can store drawings as basic elements (such as points and lines) in a
    database.
    
    PCD-CAD has all of the standard functions for drawing circles, lines,
    curves, ellipses, boxes, etc., with or without a mouse. PCD-CAD goes
    further with the ability to change the scale of drawings (great for
    logos!) and create keyboard macros. Pull-down menus make it easy to
    use.
    
    Drawings can be exported in .GEM or .WPG file format to be used in
    desktop publishing programs like Ventura Publisher and WordPerfect.
    Several text fonts are available, as well as a database of commonly
    used objects.
