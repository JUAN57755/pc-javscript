## Information about "SIMPLY LABELS III 2 OF 2 (1150 ALSO)"

    SIMPLY LABELS is a unique free form label program that lets you design
    your own label formats and maintain files containing your labels.
    
    Each label format you create can have its own standard background text,
    which can include graphics characters.  In this way you can create
    labels with blank lines or boxes for data entry.  You can also specify
    the length of the label and the number of lines each label has.  Each
    line of the label you create can have a different kind of typeface, such
    as normal print, condensed, elite, etc.  You can create mailing labels,
    tape labels, VCR labels, filing labels, or any kind of label for
    whatever you need.
    
    Designated keys can be used to enter commonly used text with a single
    keystroke.  Labels can be imported into SIMPLY LABELS from a text
    file
    or dBase III or PC-File database files.  Labels are defined by
    selecting
    database fields from a menu and placing them directly into a label
    format.
    
    Several predefined label formats are included in the program, and you
    can design up to 25 different label formats.  SIMPLY LABELS sends the
    labels to the printer, a disk file, or the screen.  You can print
    single
    or multiple copies of labels, and print multiple labels across the
    printer.  Powerful searching and sorting routines allow you to select
    and organize your labels any way you like.
