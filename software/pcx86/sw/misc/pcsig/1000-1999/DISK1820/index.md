## Information about "DOCUHELP"

    DOCUMENTOR allows you to use your own documentation text file to create
    an on-line user's manual and an associated index file for that manual.
    Use it primarily as a display tool once the documentation files are
    created, or as a conversion tool for the documentation.  Finally, create
    the index file to be used by the program.
    
    When used as a display tool the program will window up on the lower
    portion of the screen and display the document which you have specified.
    You will also be able to use the index which you specified to go to
    various places in the document to provide an easy method for finding
    various places within the document.  If you use the program with the
    index display option you will be able to add index descriptions and line
    numbers to the index file with only a few simple keystrokes.
    
    When used as a conversion tool the program will convert a text file
    (which you create with your own wordprocessor or text editor) to a
    DOCUMENTOR file, which then can be used by the program to provide an
    on-line display tool for your document.
