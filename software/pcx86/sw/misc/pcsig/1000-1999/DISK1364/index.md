## Information about "PKZIP, PKUNZIP, AND PKSFX"

    Whoa! Hold on there guys! There's a new program in town!
    
    PKZIP is the new file compression system from PKWARE that lets you cram
    a lot more programs and data onto that precious, crowded real estate of
    your hard disk by shrinking it all into small archived ZIP files.
    Other things PKZIP can do for you: When you need to take your data on
    the go, ZIPping means you will have fewer floppies to carry or lose!
    Downloads and backing-up your system will go faster. ZIPped files also
    take less time to transmit via a modem. Many BBSs (computer bulletin
    board services) are now using ZIP files as their standard.
    
    PKZIP also handles all your file maintenance needs, including adding and
    deleting files, and reporting on technical information from within
    compressed files.
    
    PKUNZIP is the complementary program that reconstructs or extracts
    compressed files. In addition to reconstructing a complete ZIP file, it
    can selectively release individual files, show files on the screen for
    fast viewing, or print them. PKSFX creates self-extracting archive
    files. Archived files may be updated, listed to the screen, annotated
    with comments, printed, and password protected.
    
    Included is a 28-page on-disk manual telling you everything you could
    ever want to know about how compression works.
