## Information about "ON-SIDE"

    ON-SIDE prints reports down the page (on their side), instead of across,
    in a variety of character font styles.  It is useful for a presentation
    which looks perfect on the screen, but when you attempt to print it,
    it's too wide to fit on the paper.  If a report overlaps onto two or
    three pages, the perforations can be left connected so a really wide
    report folds up nicely for filing.  ON-SIDE is perfect for use with a
    spreadsheet, wordprocessor or any other program that can write its
    printed output to a disk.
