## Information about "THE ITEMIZED CALCULATOR"

    ITEMIZED CALCULATOR allows you to create an electronic list of item
    descriptions that automatically tracks quantities, prices, price
    extensions and totals. Whether you're making a shopping list,
    tracking inventory or updating stock portfolio transactions, the
    system does the job in a quick, straightforward manner.
    
    Set up data files to define units to be tracked, the tracking
    category, and the unit costs. Call up the item and enter the number of
    units bought or sold and ITEMIZED CALCULATOR does the rest,
    calculating costs and totals. Sort and print item lists according to
    description, price, or price extension, in ascending or descending
    order. The 60-page on-disk manual is clear and comprehensive.
    
    With the advent of low-cost laptop computers, ITEMIZED CALCULATOR has
    uses ranging from recording rack-jobbing inventory to listing sales,
    revenue and expenses for a flea market operation.
