## Information about "PC-MENU"

    This menu system is for those who want the convenience of a menu, yet
    need to keep an eye on their computer's vital signs.  When you run
    PC-MENU the date and the time will appear at the top.  The bottom left
    of the screen will show the name of the current drive, the number of
    free bytes on the disk and the percentage of total free space.
    
    The lower right corner will show the current status of the Caps Lock,
    Num Lock, Scroll Lock and INS keys.  Below this is the size of the
    computer's memory, including any AT extended memory.  There are four
    function keys and several other keys active when executing a menu.
    These keys offer you on-line help, the ability to edit menus, and the
    capability of changing colors.  This is a menu that's easy if you're a
    novice, and still functional if you're not.
