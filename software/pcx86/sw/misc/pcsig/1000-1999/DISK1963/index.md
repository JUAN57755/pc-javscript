## Information about "TRACKSTAR I & CALENDAR PROGRAM BY SMALL"

    Print a year's worth of calendar, four months per 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of
    paper, for any year from 1990 through 1999.  The program was designed to
    print the output using the Epson or Epson-type printer codes.  The
    operating instructions are quite simple and prompts are available where
    needed.
    
    If you have regular appointments and your current calendar is making you
    enter each one separately, TRACKSTAR specializes in repetitive
    scheduling.  The repetition cycles can be defined by the number of days,
    the number of months, twice a month (15 days apart), or three special
    monthly cycles.  Great for reminding yourself of when your bills are to
    be paid each month.  You can even set an early reminder prompt for any
    number of days in advance.  Of course the calendar is just as effective
    with one-time appointments.
