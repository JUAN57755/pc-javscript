## Information about "OVL312"

    OVL is a powerful overlay manager system for use with Microsoft LINK.
    Overlays are portions of program code which are loaded from disk into
    memory on an "as-needed" basis.  Overlays allow a very large program to
    use a relatively small amount of memory.
    
    LINK.EXE, Microsoft's Overlay Linker, included with MS-DOS and Microsoft
    languages, versions 3.x, 5.x, and some 2.x versions, allow creation of
    overlaid programs.  However, LINK only inserts software interrupts and
    some overlay information in the program for an overlay manager to use.
    LINK doesn't provide the actual code that loads the proper overlay from
    disk and passes control to it.  That's a job for an overlay manager, and
    that's where the OVL overlay managers come in.
    
    OVL "manages" overlays.  OVL loads overlays from disk at the appropriate
    time and jumps program execution to the overlay code.  OVL managers have
    been tested with MASM 4.0 and 5.0; Turbo C 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0; QuickBASIC
    4.0 and 4.5; Microsoft's BASCOM 6.0; and Clipper (PRONK.EXE, an included
    support utility, must be used with Clipper programs).  Other languages
    that compile to standard Microsoft Overlay LINKable object modules may
    also work with OVL.
