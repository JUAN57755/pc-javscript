## Information about "BSR"

    Transfer files back and forth between computers using different sizes
    of disk drives; e.g., between laptop 3.5" disk drives and desktop 5.25"
    drives.  BSR is particularly handy in situations where you don't have
    copies of the .EXE program on both 3.5" and 5.25" media.  BASIC versions
    of the Send and Receive programs are included and can be typed into both
    computers relatively quickly.  Then all that's needed is a version of
    BASIC to run the Send and Receive programs.
