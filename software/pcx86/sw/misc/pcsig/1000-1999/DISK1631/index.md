## Information about "EXAM BANK"

    Teachers give EXAM BANK an A+ because it takes the hassle out of
    testing.  Its ability to quickly change test questions means that
    teachers will never again need to give the same examination twice.  With
    one extra keystroke, teachers can scramble the sequence of questions,
    thus preparing two tests for the same class.  The program even generates
    printed answer sheets.
    
    Crossmatch questions are produced without hassle.  Matches are entered
    side by side.  Each time the question is printed the program scrambles
    both columns into a different order and then prints a correct answer
    sheet.
    
    EXAM BANK stores examination questions of the type most commonly used by
    teachers and professors:  multiple choice, true/false, short answer,
    essay and cross match.  It allows for complete editing or deletion and
    replacement of previously written questions.  Best of all, EXAM BANK's
    question entry screens have wordprocessing features and full cursor
    control key usage.
