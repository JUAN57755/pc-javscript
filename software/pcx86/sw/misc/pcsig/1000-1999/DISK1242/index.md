## Information about "HAL9000"

    Hal is back and he's in charge of your system! Hal, the mutinous,
    homicidal computer from the movie "2001, A Space Odyssey" will keep
    you organized and on schedule with unnerving prompts like, "I'm
    sorry, Dave, but ..." He'll not only tell your fortune, he'll fill you
    in as to what happened historically every day.
    
    HAL9000 is an almanac, philosopher, clock/calendar, and a memo calendar
    all rolled into one. He comes complete with sound track music from the
    movie. When invoked, he displays time and date, what famous birthdays
    occur that date and a humorous, informative quotation. The opening
    screen can display a short memo the user designated for that date.
    HAL9000 has a separate pop-up screen to track appointments, and
    another screen displays a three month calendar.
    
    To use the Almanac, enter any date and HAL will respond with what
    happened on that date in history. The Fortune Cookie generates an
    electronic fortune based on your sex and birth date.
