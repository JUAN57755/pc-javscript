## Information about "LINEWARS"

    LINEWARS is a two-user three dimensional space war game.  It makes the
    most of your graphics display adapters with high definition graphics.
    You can play LINEWARS alone or against a friend using a modem or cable.
    
    You are looking at your opponent from your Cobra Mark IV multi-purpose
    General Contact Vehicle.  Your ship is equipped with an energy shield,
    up to six missiles and two beam lasers, front and rear.
    
    The events of this game take place far away in intergalactic space,
    where stars are few and alien vessels common.  Therefore, you should pay
    attention not only to your opponent but also to all other ships in your
    vicinity.  And there is always the chance that your missile launching
    system may jam.  If this happens, you cannot use missiles during the
    battle.
    
    Supports a mouse and ports COM1 to COM4 and speeds of 300 to 19200 bps.
    It has an easy-to-use menu-driven interface for various game settings.
    Includes a terminal program with dialing and auto-answer features.
