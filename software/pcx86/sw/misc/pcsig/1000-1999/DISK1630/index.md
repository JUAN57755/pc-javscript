## Information about "READFAST!"

    Don't believe in "speed reading?"  READFAST! is here to prove you
    wrong.
    
    READFAST! first explains some of the causes of slow reading and then
    shows you how reading and comprehension can be improved.  In addition to
    theory, READFAST! will measure a user's reading speed and then introduce
    exercises that will help improve upon that benchmark.
    
    READFAST! can be used with any book; for some of the exercises, you will
    need to mark up the book.  Anyone who reads should investigate this
    educational bonanza.
