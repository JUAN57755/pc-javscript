## Information about "GRAPH FOR FORTRAN"

    This collection of FORTRAN subroutines will make it simple for you to
    plot high quality scientific and engineering graphs on dot matrix
    printers which have the ability to print graphics.  These subroutines
    can be incorporated easily into any FORTRAN program, so that your own
    programs can automatically print high resolution graphs as part of the
    program output.
    
    Also included is a sample program to illustrate the use of the
    subroutines.  This sample program works as a stand-alone graph plotter
    for plotting graphs from a data file.  As an alternative to
    incorporating the graph plotting subroutines into your own programs, you
    could instead get your program to write a data file to disk for later
    plotting using the sample program supplied.
    
    Features include resolution options, vertical or horizontal plotting,
    linear or logarithmic axes, labelling of axes, overlaying grid lines on
    the graph, joining points with straight lines or a cubic spline,
    plotting user-defined functions, passing a list of parameters to the
    user-defined functions, and placing text on the graph.
