## Information about "ROOM"

    This program helps you find the best location in your stereo room for
    the loudspeakers and the "sweet spot" listening position.
    
    Properly locating the speakers and listening positions avoids the low
    frequency intensity variations caused by room generated standing wave
    patterns.  Hand calculating the best positions is tedious.  This
    program will allow you to find several acceptable set-ups which can
    avoid the overbearing bass and poor transient response due to improperly
    situated speakers.  Not for use with dipole radiators.
