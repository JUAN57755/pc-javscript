## Information about "THE NIGHT SKY 2 OF 4 (1796,2139,2140)"

    This computer planetarium is capable of plotting 24,000 stars to
    magnitude +7.49. The registered version is capable of plotting 45,000
    stars to magnitude +8.49. THE NIGHT SKY is a very easy to use
    menu-driven program for the amateur astronomer. In fact, this program
    was
    written by an amateur astronomer who, when he is not looking at the
    stars, drives a London transport bus. He has spent many of his off
    hours working on this program, which originally started as an exercise
    in programming.
    
    Use THE NIGHT SKY to draw a star map and move around the sky, show the
    night sky to a magnification and resolution of your choice, plot all the
    planets and the Moon any time from January 1, 1600 to December 31, 3000;
    predict solar and lunar eclipses; and view your local sky. Also covered
    are comets, the minor planets, the sun, moon, and satellites of Jupiter.
    From the stars menu you can choose the constellations, 21 brightest
    stars, bright star catalogue, map the night sky, star atlas, deep sky,
