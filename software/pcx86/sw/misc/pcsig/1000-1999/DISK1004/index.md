## Information about "HIRE"

    HIRE is a must for any manager or personnel officer who has a need to
    keep track of applications and resumes.  HIRE lets you monitor all the
    people who apply for specific jobs, grants, or any other positions.
    
    HIRE uses merge files to help you respond professionally in writing to
    everyone.  It writes letters to send to applicants, acknowledging their
    applications, alerting those who have not sent all support documents,
    and rejecting those who don't qualify.  You can personalize the merge
    files, by including the applicant's personal data, such as title, name,
    address, etc.
    
    HIRE can handle from 300-500 applicants, and can help you screen them
    according to your criteria.
