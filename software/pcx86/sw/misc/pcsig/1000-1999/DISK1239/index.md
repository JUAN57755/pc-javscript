## Information about "THE AEIUS GRADEBOOK"

    AEIUS offers teachers and administrators with multiple classes a
    versatile way to keep grade records of every sort.  A fast,
    comprehensive program, AEIUS GRADEBOOK handles up to 20 classes of 48
    students each, with 64 assignments per term.
    
    Teachers can grade by letters, numbers, or virtually any known grading
    system.  Student names can be encoded for privacy and security.
    Individual and class grades can be averaged, and adjusted to curves with
    different weights given different assignments and tests.  It keeps tabs
    on missed assignments.  Makeup grades are found at the touch of a key.
    Missing grades can be optionally excused or counted into grade averages.
    Weekly, monthly, and semester averages are generated, displayed, and
    printed for individuals or classes, if desired.  Grade distributions can
    be calculated and graphed, and the teacher's comments printed.
    
    Using a window system to display every facet of the program, AEIUS
    GRADEBOOK guides the user every step of the way.  Help screens are
    always at hand.  Finding and correcting errors is easy.  The ability to
    print out individual and class report cards gives AEIUS an A+.  The
    small amount of RAM memory used permits AEIUS GRADEBOOK to be used on
    nearly any PC.  The 20-page on-disk manual assumes virtually no
    computer knowledge on the part of users, teaches basics, and works its
    way into the program.
