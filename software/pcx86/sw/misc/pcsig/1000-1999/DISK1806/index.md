## Information about "MICRO REGISTER"

    MICRO REGISTER is a point-of-sale and invoicing program designed to
    automate a retail or service related business. MICRO REGISTER can be
    set up for many different types of business applications. You can print
    invoices for customers, statements for charged sales or services, and
    even generate price quotations.
    
    The program keeps track of inventory and customer account information
    and gives you the option of using a salesperson file that will
    automatically give you total commissions earned by each salesperson.
    Income is recorded on a daily, monthly, and year-to-date basis. These
    totals can be printed at any time and have password protection.
    
    MICRO REGISTER produces many printed reports such as inventory item
    lists, item below reorder level, customer and sales personnel list, and
    will print price labels for your inventory. MICRO REGISTER can hold
    65,000 inventory item numbers, 65,000 customer accounts, and 100
    salespeople in its database.
