## Information about "NETHACK   AN ADVENTURE GAME"

    NETHACK is a huge Dungeons & Dragons-type adventure game of 20-plus
    levels, 150-plus rooms, and countless corridors.  Dangers abound in
    this game.  Besides a huge inventory of monsters, there are many traps
    awaiting the unwary.  Also, many of the treasures you find (and you
    find plenty if you live long enough) turn out to be very hazardous to
    your health.  In fact, if you are an average beginning player, we can
    safely predict that you will probably not get past level three during
    the first 10 games you play (unless you happen to fall through a trap
    door).
    
    Expanded features include: new character classes and weapons, armor
    weights. new tools. polymorph self spell (in the magic library).
    rockmoles and Keystone Kops who throw cream pies (in the caverns),
    squeeky board and magic traps, fountains, and magic markers.
