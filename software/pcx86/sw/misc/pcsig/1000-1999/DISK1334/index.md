## Information about "TOUCH TYPE TUTOR"

    TOUCH TYPE TUTOR is going to make you the fastest typist in town.  Or if
    you don't know how to type, this program will teach you.
    
    The program has three teaching modes.  The first is for the person who
    knows how to type, but wants to be faster.  It provides four different
    letters on which you are tested.  After you have become proficient on
    these, you can add your own letters for variety.  The second mode is a
    graduated series of lessons that allow you to move along at your own
    pace.  The third mode is a game for the beginning typist that teaches
    the keyboard layout.
