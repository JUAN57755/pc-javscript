## Information about "ABSTRACT (LORAN LOCATOR NOW ON #1542)"

    ABSTRACT is designed for cataloging and labeling photographs and other
    similar items such as sound recordings, video tapes, motion pictures,
    computer disks, paintings, etc.  It can also be used for other database
    applications such as addresses, suppliers, lists, etc.
    
    Each photo/tape/disk is described in a record that has four sorting
    fields and fits on a single line for easy printing and reviewing.  The
    four fields represent categories of your choice, such as roll number,
    item number, frame number, name, description, date, subject matter,
    etc.  Records can be sorted, edited, searched, viewed, and printed as
    reports, as well as labels to fit both slides and prints.
    
    Each database holds 950 entries, but multiple databases can be joined
    for searching.  Pull-down menus and help screens lead you through every
    option.  Mouse compatible.
