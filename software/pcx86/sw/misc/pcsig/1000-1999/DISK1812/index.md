## Information about "EASY QUOTE"

    Do you need an easy-to-use price quoting program and only need to keep
    track of products with a single unit cost and price?  EASY QUOTE will
    make your price quoting easier and faster.  The program is designed to
    allow the printed quote to be used as a billing invoice.  Automatic
    search tables and scrolling windows give you instant access to your
    products and prices.
    
    The program provides a customer name and address file, product file,
    multiple company file and quote files.  These files are maintained by
    the system, giving you a built-in record keeping system.  You won't have
    to fumble through documents trying to find a quote you prepared last
    week, you can simply go into the system and retrieve the quote.  EASY
    QUOTE offers virtually unlimited record capacities.  It will even blank
    your monitor screen after 10 minutes of inactivity to protect it from
    burn in.
    
    Well maintained costs and prices will make it easy for you to provide
    accurate quotes.
