## Information about "RECORDS & TAPES DATABASE"

    RECORDS & TAPES organizes and catalogs all your records and tapes.
    
    Ideal for anyone with large collections, this database can store up to
    400 albums on a single disk and up to 32,000 on a hard disk.  It lets
    you search for a particular album or cut by title, artist, music style,
    or other categories of your choice, and print lists of your entire
    collection sorted alphabetically or by category.  It can even print
    individual "library cards" for each album, designed to fit in a
    rolodex file.
    
    You can display the database in several modes, two of which are hide and
    dim.  In the hide mode, only those records meeting the search criteria
    are displayed.  In the dim mode, the selected records are shown on the
    screen in bright characters, while all others appear in dim characters.
