## Information about "DRIVECHK & ALIGN"

    This package should occupy a prominent place on the reference shelves
    of any computer repairman!  Just about everything you'd ever want or
    need to know about disk drive diagnosis and adjustment is included in
    DRIVECHK & ALIGN.  The diagnostics provided are quite easy to learn and
    operate.  However, be warned that both special tools and some level of
    hands-on technical experience in the repair field are necessary to use
    all the power built into this package!
    
    The two separate documentation packages included are very thorough and
    obviously written by an expert in the field of drive repair and
    adjustment.  Subjects are approached in an understandable step-by-step
    manner.  You can't go wrong at the price, even if you're a rookie who
    only uses the program for periodic tests of proper drive function.
