    This software and audio cassette combination package may be just what

unexpected quiz or test every now and then, thrown in to help you evaluate
your progress! An audio cassette tape and manual can be ordered from an
800 phone number for $23.95 to assure your pronounciation is as sharp as
your written knowledge.
