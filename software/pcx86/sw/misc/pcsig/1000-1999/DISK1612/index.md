## Information about "TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY AND METEORS"

    TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY implements the game allegedly invented in 1909 by E.T.
    Baker of the Knickerbocker Whist Club of New York, with optional
    automatic sorting of your hand to give the best score.  You play against
    the computer, which plays a mean game.  Your hand is displayed at the
    top of the screen, the computer's hand is displayed under yours.  To
    learn the game, you can choose to play with open hands, meaning that you
    can see the computer's hand but it can't see yours.  The computer
    shuffles, deals, and keeps all scores current.
    
    You can choose from 3 different variations of GIN RUMMY; Standard,
    Oklahoma (Cedarhurst), and Tommy's Space Cowboy.  A hot key demo mode is
    available, in which you can watch the computer play against itself, a
    great way to learn how to play this all-time favorite card game with
    plenty of music and color.  It works both on mono and color screens.
