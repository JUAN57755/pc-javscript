## Information about "PC-DEAL"

    PC-DEAL is a double-entry ledger program, an application of cash
    accounting. The object is to keep track of cash or money. Where is it
    coming from? Where is it going? How much is available? How much is
    owed?
    
    The basic mechanisms for doing this are the account and the transaction.
    PC-DEAL supports 300 accounts and up to 1,200 transactions per month. It
    maintains a journal of transactions entered and a separate ledger and
    transaction journal for each account.
    
    PC-DEAL is designed for double entry booking; that is, the specification
    of two account numbers (the To/Debit and From/Credit accounts), for each
    transaction. The transaction is recorded in two account ledgers and a
    balance is maintained between the cash coming in and the cash going out.
    
    PC-DEAL maintains transaction journals and account ledgers for a period
    of thirteen months -- the twelve month accounting period and the first
    month of the next year.
    
    Generate and print the following reports:
    
    ~  Chart of accounts
    
    ~  Cash flow
    
    ~  Monthly transactions journal
    
    ~  Trial balance
    
    ~  Balance sheet
    
    ~  Monthly income and expense
    
    ~  Monthly activity in asset and liability accounts
    
    ~  Change in net asset value
    
    ~  Budget comparison
    
    ~  Budget projection
    
    ~  Annual income and expense
    
    ~  Annual asset and liability account activity.
    
    PC-DEAL is fully menu-driven and intuitive to operate.
