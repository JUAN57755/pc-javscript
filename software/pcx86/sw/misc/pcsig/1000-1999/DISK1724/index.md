## Information about "THE ELECTRIC ALMANAC"

    THE ELECTRIC ALMANAC is an elegant computerized book that offers in-
    formation and advice on the best dates and times for accomplishing many
    different tasks.  Like the traditional almanac, it looks to the moon and
    stars for the proper times for planting, asking for a raise, starting a
    new relationship, or any of the other really important questions of life
    -- including when to go to the dentist.  Like the traditional almanac,
    but with far more depth, it offers information on astrological charts,
    tables of planetary hours and astronomy tables. You can not only insert
    your choice of time and date, but also your longitude, latitude and the
    meteorological zone so that the ELECTRIC ALMANAC can give readings
    specific for your area.
    
    And like a traditional almanac, THE ELECTRIC ALMANAC offers tidbits of
    important information such as metric conversion tables and a variety of
    oracles from I-Ching and Tarot to the not-so-traditional "Almanac
    Oracle."  Best of all, THE ELECTRIC ALMANAC accomplishes this in a
    clear, self explanatory format -- all entries are available by high-
    lighting and entering.  You may miss the 19th century illustrations and
    the bad riddles and puns, but THE ELECTRIC ALMANAC makes up for the loss
    with a friendly interactive approach that makes opening up this book
    similar to a chat with a very knowledgeable old friend.
