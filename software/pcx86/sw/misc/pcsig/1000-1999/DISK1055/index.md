## Information about "LOAN WARRIOR"

    LOAN WARRIOR is a full-featured loan amortization program that not only
    calculates monthly payments but also helps you make decisions about a
    loan by letting you compare different terms or early payoff.  It works
    with both fixed and variable interest rates.  Given the
    principal, the interest rate, and the term of the loan, LOAN WARRIOR
    gives a complete monthly amortization schedule, yearly interest
    payments, yearly principal payments, and both a detailed and summary
    report.  An accelerated payoff option is included, analyzing money that
    can be saved by making larger payments.
