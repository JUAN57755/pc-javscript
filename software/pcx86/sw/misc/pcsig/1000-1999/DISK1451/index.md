## Information about "DISK DUPLICATOR"

    DISKDUP makes it easy to make multiple floppy copies of all your
    favorite shareware programs for your friends.  It is also handy for
    disk librarians, teachers, and others needing multiple copies of a
    disk.  Written in Forth, the program is faster than the standard DOS
    DISKCOPY, with more user options.  It allows the user to copy only
    allocated sectors as a time saving feature.  It has options to format
    disks, verify copies and detect any write errors and will try three
    times to read a disk section before giving up in disgust.
    
    Because DISKDUP loads the source disk to be duplicated into its
    virtual memory, it frees up both of your disk drives to crank out two
    copies at a time!  The volume name of the source disk is always shown
    on the screen so you don't wind up duping a bunch of copies of the
    wrong program.  An optional alert signal lets you do something else
    while DISKDUP takes care of the copying, calling you when it's time to
    pop in two more blank disks.  A counter lets you know how many copies
    have already been made.
