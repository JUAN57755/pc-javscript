## Information about "HOME BARTENDER'S GUIDE #1 (1517)"

    You may not learn how to juggle bottles in the air like Tom Cruise did
    in the movie "Cocktail," but HOME BARTENDER will teach you the secrets
    to
    mixing all those hysterical drinks you saw being happily quaffed by his
    patrons!
    
    Learn how to make drinks like a professional bartender, including the
    Alabama Slammer, Colorado Bulldog, Fuzzy Navel, Harvey Wallbanger,
    Orgasm, Rusty Nail, Singapore Sling, and 142 more libation favorites.
    
    The drinks are divided into categories which include frozen drinks,
    Polynesian drinks, cream drinks, non-alcoholic drinks, martinis and
    Manhattans, champagne and wine drinks, and coffee drinks, etc. For each
    drink HOME BARTENDER provides the ingredients, the directions, and what
    type of glass should be used.  All the drinks may be selected from a
    system of menus, or referenced from the index. Information is also
