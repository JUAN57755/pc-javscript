## Information about "THE INVOICER"

    Designed for companies that sell products or services to a number of
    accounts, INVOICER quickly cranks out custom invoices, statements and
    overdue notices. It also tracks billings and sales activities,
    maintains a journal of your customers and a list of your company's stock
    or service items, and produces a variety of reports, including aging.
    Invoices are automatically posted to accounts receivable (included with
    this program) using either the open-item or balance-forward system, and
    taxes and finance charges are calculated for you. An installation
    program makes it easy to put INVOICER on your hard drive.
