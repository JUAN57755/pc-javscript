## Information about "CHECKBOOKS & BUDGETS PLUS"

    This disk has a full-featured checkbook database, check printing and
    budgeting program which lets you keep track of your personal checking
    and savings accounts with ease. CHECKBOOKS & BUDGETS PLUS helps you
    automatically set aside a portion of your income into each different
    category in your budget. The budgeting section of the program is
    completely flexible letting you move budgeted funds from account to
    account at will.
    
    Features include: an easy-to-use, windowed, menu-driven, checkbook and
    budgeting system; full multi-colored displays with pop-up windows for
    easy readability; optional printing of industry-standard checks,
    built-in help menu system; instant hot key listings at any time from

    index files for quick data storage and retrieval and provides multiple
    format listings to screen, printer, files or print spooler. It also
    makes financial reports, automatically balances your check register,
    quickly reconciles your check register with your monthly bank statement,
    and makes financial and loan calculations. The program can also exit to
