## Information about "VARI-TALE"

    VARITALE is a "branching authoring system" designed to run either
    locally on your computer screen, or as a "door" on BBS systems such as
    PCBoard, RBBS, NoChange, Fido, ROS, Sapphire, and so on.
    
    You will be able to write stories (known in VARITALE as "books") that
    have alternate chapters. At any point, there is always an alternative.
    In VARITALE, each step (known in VARITALE as "chapters") can be up to 50
    lines long. After each step, there can be up to 5 alternative chapters.
    
    This allows you and other people to create "story-rounds," in which
    everybody contributes chapters to the tale. Story-rounds are quite
    popular on BBS systems, but there is a problem: somebody will take the
    story in the wrong direction, and the other writers get annoyed. And
    that is the end of that story.
    
    With VARITALE, the writers can propose alternate chapters, either in
    response to an inappropriate effort by another writer, or simply to
    explore a different facet of the story. This version is limited to
    three books.
