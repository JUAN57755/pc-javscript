One-Nil    -     This is a highly sophisticated soccer
                 management simulation game. You manage
                 all aspects of a team in either Scottish
                 or English Leagues: players, tactics,
                 staff, financial, etc. Game by game visual
                 gameplay allows you to monitor and make
                 moment to moment changes in single player
                 or entire team tactics.
