## Information about "WRITER'S NAMEBASE"

    Looking for a first name that suggests wealth and beauty for that great
    novel you're writing?  How about a name that suggests intelligence and
    honesty for that newborn.  WRITER'S NAMEBASE has hundreds of great
    suggestions.
    
    Either specify a first name or select the qualities that you want in a
    first name and NAMEBASE will make suggestions.  It will also list out
    nicknames and related names -- some in other languages.  If you are a
    writer, NAMEBASE allows you to change the existing database of names and
    add names of your own.  The registered version includes names for
    different nationalities and science fiction characters.
    
    Also included is a companion program called HEROINE.  This program takes
    a male name and creates a tongue-in-cheek female name for use in romance
    novels.  For the name "George" it returns:  Georgette, Georgetta,
    Georgeen, Georgeanne, Georgina, and Georgia.
