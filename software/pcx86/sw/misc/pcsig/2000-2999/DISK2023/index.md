## Information about "ACTIVE LIFE FOR OS/2 PM"

    Think a computer is too much hassle to replace your DayTimer?  Or maybe
    your current appointment calendar doesn't have the strength you need?
    ACTIVE LIFE is an extremely powerful system for planning, managing, and
    tracking one's active business and personal life that takes advantage of
    your mouse (though a mouse is not required).  Also, if you have
    MS-Windows, there is a version especially for you (disk #1481).
    
    The flexible schedules manage workflow effectively and all types of
    recurring activities need be entered just once.  ACTIVE LIFE also
    includes pop-up calendars, alarms, and week-at-a-glance.  Printed
    schedules provide reference and notation.
    
    While you can use ACTIVE LIFE with only a keyboard, a mouse is highly
    recommended.
