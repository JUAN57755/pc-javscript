## Information about "PAINT SHOP & WALLMAC"

    PAINT SHOP is a Windows program that converts files between PCX, BMP,
    and GIF formats.  If you have any PCX or GIF files this program will
    convert them to BMP format, which can be used to change the background
    (wallpaper) on Windows.
    
    If you are tired of the wallpaper files that come with Windows, check
    out these two new background screens that you can use to customize your
    desktop with, and even impress Mac users.
    
    You get the original monochrome Macintosh(tm) background screen, and the
    newer color Mac II (tm), to use instead of the ribbons, paper, and other
    backgrounds that Windows offers you. These two BMP screens "look so
    realistic that you will find yourself reaching for the pull-down menus!"
