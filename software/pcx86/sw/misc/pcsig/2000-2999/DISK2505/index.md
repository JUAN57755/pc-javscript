Disk Title: Commander Keen:Invasion of the Vorticons                    
PC-SIG Version: S1.32                                                   
                                                                        
Program Title: COMMANDER KEEN                                           
Author Version: 1.31                                                    
Author Registration: $15.00 for each volume.                            
Special Requirements: 530K RAM, EGA/VGA, and high density drive.        
                                                                        
Commander Keen pushes graphics to the limit.  It's truly a "commercial  
quality" game that Nintendo and arcade fans will appreciate.  It        
features ultra high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and superb sound
effects.  The animation and scrolling is updated at 60 frames per second
(motion picture quality cartoons are filmed at only 24 frames per       
second).                                                                
                                                                        
The story of Commander Keen is epic in the style of the memorable       
matinee serials like Flash Gordan.  You play the role of Billy Blaze, an
eight year-old child genius who builds an interstellar ship when not    
working at home on his college fast-track degree.  Among other household
objects, Billy uses his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his    
mom's vacuum cleaner (heavily modified) for his ship's ion propulsion   
system (with pile height adjustment).                                   
                                                                        
At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football      
helmet and becomes "Commander Keen" -- defender of Earth!  Ever on the  
side of justice, fairness, and high calorie junk food, Keen dispenses   
justice with an iron hand.                                              
                                                                        
"Marooned on Mars" is volume one of the Commander Keen trilogy.  (Only  
part one is available via shareware distribution, the other two volumes 
may only be purchased from Apogee Software Productions.)  Each volume   
has its own unique appearance, with different goals, graphics, game     
characters, animation and locations.                                    
                                                                        
Volumes of Commander Keen are $15, or you can order (and register) all  
three volumes for just $30.  As an incentive to order all three volumes,
you'll also receive a hint sheet, a cheat mode password, and new bonus  
games from ASP.  Plus, you'll be able to call the Commander Keen hints  
line or mail questions to ASP for assistance.
