## Information about "EASYMAIL - NETWORK EMAIL"

    Here's a very easy-to-use electronic mail program for networks which

    authorized user with a complete environment for creating documents,
    selecting addressees, reading mail, and tailoring the program to their
    specific needs.  Other features include text importing, document
    printing, and mail archiving.  It works on all NetBIOS compatible
    networks (all popular networks). This version allows up to five users.
