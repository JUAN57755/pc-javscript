## Information about "PEG SOLITAIRE"

    PEG SOLITAIRE is played on a playing board shaped in the form of a plus
    sign. The board has 33 holes with 32 pegs.  (The center hole of the
    board is left empty.)  The object is to remove all but one of the pegs
    from the board jumping one peg at a time.
    
    COLOR PEG is a second game.  This board has 24 pegs divided into
    different colored groups of 6 pegs each.  The object of this game is to
    jump pegs until all peg groups have exchanged positions.  You win when
    the top and bottom peg groups have swapped places and the right and left
    peg groups have done the same.
    
    Both of these games are simple to operate, but difficult to master. Use
    the keyboard or mouse to move around.
