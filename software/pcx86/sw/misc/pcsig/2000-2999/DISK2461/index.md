## Information about "WINDOWS UTILITIES"

    Want to bring some excitement, or at least variety, into the hours
    you spend staring through Windows?  This public domain program from
    Buttonware gives you a different background (.BMP) file each time
    Windows is started.
    
    SCREEN PEACE for Windows 3.0 not only blanks the monitor, but fills it
    with frills.  Instead of a blank screen, you'll see animated fish eat
    each other onscreen.  It contains 13 other graphic options, from the
    wavy lines to wobbling spheres.  Other users have written their own
    animated sequences using a C compiler.
    
    SCREEN PEACE lets users customize everything from the speed of the fish
    to the length of the delay before blanking.  It also allows immediate
    blanking by pushing the mouse arrow into a corner.  Another option tells
    Windows to boot up with fresh wallpaper each morning.
    
    With Whiskers you can assign keystrokes to the middle and right mouse
    buttons.  You could, for example, make the right button on the mouse be
    the DELETE key.  For use with Windows 3.0.
    
    Mark30 is a utility that marks old Windows applications so they will run
    under Windows 3.0 without the Windows 3.0 warning message.  This utility
    does no checking of the application being marked, except to verify that
    it is a Windows application.
    
    Many Windows 2.x application work fine under Windows 3.0, but many do
    not.  If you have a Windows 2.x application that works under Windows
    3.0, and you are tired of the annoying warning message Windows 3.0 gives
    you each time you run your program, Mark30 will save you that
    aggravation.
