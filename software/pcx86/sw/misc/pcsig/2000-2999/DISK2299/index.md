## Information about "SON OF STAGEFRIGHT"

    This is a text adventure game with a theatrical twist. Things just
    aren't going right for you. For starters, you're locked inside an old
    abandoned theater. The little voice inside you is screaming, "GET OUT
    OF HERE!" As you try to get out, you'll encounter creaky catwalks,
    raging rivers, mini-mazes, rogues, rats and a zookeeper. You'll also
    endure puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and some mild
    innuendo.
    
    This game was written using the Adventure Game Toolkit (PC-SIG Disk #
    1231,1232) and was the winner of the text adventure contest sponsored
    by the authors of the Toolkit.
