## Information about "AMORTIZE"

    Would you like to know what a loan costs before talking to your
    banker?  Would you like to know how much profit you could make
    before loaning your money to someone?  Would you like to compare the
    cost of a loan using different interest rates?  If these or other
    questions are important to you, then AMORTIZE can help.  It
    helps solve such matters before you make a loan.
    
    For example, if you know the principal (amount to be borrowed), the
    interest rate, the payment amount, and certain other data, then
    AMORTIZE
    will compute the number of payments to be made.  AMORTIZE will compute
    for principal, interest, number of periods, payments, fixed principal
    amount, and for the balloon payment.
    
    AMORTIZE will save your worksheet for future reference, and also print
    to your printer or to a disk file (ASCII format for transfer purposes).
    
    It doesn't handle simple interest formulas, bond value and
    yield information, and advance payment adjustments.  But what it does
    do, it does easily and quickly.
