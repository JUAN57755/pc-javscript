## Information about "SAM'S MENU"

    SAM'S MENU is designed with large hard drives in mind, although it will
    run just as well on a 10MB hard disk as it will on a 360MB hard disk.
    Run applications can be at the touch of a single key. All
    commands or subdirectory names are entered once and SAM's MENU
    remembers them for you.  Don't worry about remembering and typing those
    complicated commands; concentrate on getting your work done.
    
    If several people use the same PC, each one can have their own menu
    screen with password protection.  Want all your utility programs on one
    screen by themselves?  Would you like to let your children use your
    computer but you don't want them in your files?  Put all their games on
    one of the menu screens, and restrict their access to the rest of the
    menuing system.  This and more is possible with SAM's MENU.
