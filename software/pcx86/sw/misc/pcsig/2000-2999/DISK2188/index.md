## Information about "PERSONNAL C SCREEN"

    The key to professional-looking programs is the screen design.
    However, producing such screens is often a tedious and time-consuming
    task.  With PERSONAL C-SCREEN the implementation of a professional
    screen layout into your C program becomes a simple task.  It has the
    following functions; interactive format generation, windows, menus,
    pop ups, pull downs, variable field and text attributes, alphanumeric
    and numeric selectable fields, mouse and printer support, and
    monochrome and color display support.
    
    PERSONAL C-SCREEN includes a set of screen management modules to
    generate the screen formats.  These interface modules let you use
    PERSONAL C-SCREEN with major C compilers such as Microsoft C,
    Microsoft Quick C, Turbo C, and Lattice C.
    
    PERSONAL C-SCREEN is invaluable to anyone wanting to improve the
    appearance of their C programs, and even comes with a demo program to
    illustrate its ease of use.
