## Information about "DAYO MENU (CLOCK & SETUP)"

    DAYO MENU is a menu system for use with the DAYO line of business
    applications, as well as any other program on your computer.  While it
    is multiuser when used on a PC-based LAN/Network, it can be run (like
    all DAYO products) as a `standalone' application.  The program is a
    QBASIC menu program and a DOS batch file that you can modify/edit.
    DAYO CLOCK is a simple clock display and optional alarm that can act as
    a job scheduler.
    
    SETUP of the DAYO MENU (CLOCK & SETUP) disk is the setup system for the
    DAYO modules and is recommended, especially when the entire DAYO system
    is being installed.
