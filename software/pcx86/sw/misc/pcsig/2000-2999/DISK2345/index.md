## Information about "ULTIMATE SCREEN MANAGER"

    The ULTIMATE SCREEN MANAGER makes it easy for you to design colorful
    screens that can be displayed from both batch and executable programs.
    Windows, menus, and data entry screens with different data entry types
    are supported.  Full mouse support can be included in any screen you
    create.  Screens can be designed to support both monochrome and color
    attributes.  The attribute mask is automatically adjusted to the type of
    display monitor currently active.  The ULTIMATE SCREEN MANAGER provides
    the ability to display screens from a batch file using environment
    variables to communicate data.  Information entered or changed on the
    screen will be present in the corresponding environment variables when
    control is returned to the batch file.  The screen editor lets you
    design screens to look exactly like you want them to look.
    
    The ULTIMATE SCREEN MANAGER comes with a demo program and screens to
    demonstrate the value and ease of its use.
