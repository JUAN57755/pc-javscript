## Information about "PC-PAYROLL W-4 MODULE"

    Compute the exact withholdings of Federal, FICA and State Taxes for up
    to 30 different employees. The tax tables are valid for 1989 taxes in
    all 50 U.S. states.
    
    PC-PAYROLL W-4 asks questions related to the IRS Form W-4 and
    automatically computes withholdings for each employee. It can also
    compute all taxes for the year 1989. It greatly reduces the amount of
    time normally spent on tax calculations, and prints individual W-4
    worksheets.
    
    Note that this program needs to be updated yearly.
