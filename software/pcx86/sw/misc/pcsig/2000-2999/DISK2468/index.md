## Information about "CRIBBAGE BY CROSBY & MASTERMIND"

    If you've beaten everyone you know at cribbage or are looking for
    someone who doesn't make mistakes counting -- CRIBBAGE BY CROSBY is
    here.  Just start up the program and CRIBBAGE does the rest.  With
    attractive color graphics, CRIBBAGE does the shuffling and deals the
    cards.  Just cut for deal and your playing cribbage.  Select cards for
    the "crib," play for points, and then the official will count'em up,
    keeping score on the on-screen cribbage board.  Even though CRIBBAGE BY
    CROSBY doesn't teach you how to play, it can operate in either a fast or
    slow mode.  Card fun has never been this easy.
    
    How many guesses would it take you to figure out a secret six- or
    seven-digit number? How about if you got clues? Have fun and test your
    logical thought process with MASTERMIND. MASTERMIND determines the
    secret number and you have to guess it. Each time you guess, it tells
    you how many digits were correct, but not which ones! You take it from
    there and try to solve the secret in the fewest guesses.
    
    Three different versions are included for all skill levels. MASTERMIND
    is easy to use, includes all the game instructions on help screens, and
    supports a mouse.
