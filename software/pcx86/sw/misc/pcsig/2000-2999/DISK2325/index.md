## Information about "COMMAND POST"

    COMMAND POST is a powerful file manager and custom menu system for
    Microsoft Windows 3.0 that lets you tailor your Windows-based
    workstations to your needs and preferences.  The Text-based nature of
    COMMAND POST preserves screen real-estate, the batch file/basic-type
    language gives you unprecedented power in a Windows menu system.
    
    COMMAND POST does a lot more than just make it easy to start programs.
    It gets your work done faster and more accurately by reducing tedious
    error-prone manual steps.  A single COMMAND POST menu item can gather
    filenames and other information into listboxes for the user to choose
    from, perform arithmetic, parse strings, move and resize windows, read
    and write WIN.INI variables, read DOS environment variables; copy,
    move, and delete files, and more.
    
    Use COMMAND POST to turn your workstation into a power station!
