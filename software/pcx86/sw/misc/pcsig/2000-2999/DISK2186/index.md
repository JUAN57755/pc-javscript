## Information about "YOUR NETWORTH"

    Turn your PC into a personal financial planning assistant with YOUR
    NETWORTH, a 1-2-3 template that lets you take snapshots of
    your investment portfolio and forecast your financial future.
    It's your personal financial planning and analysis tool.
    
    YOUR NETWORTH provides the means to track, manage, and assess your
    overall net worth.  It provides fixed income management, financial
    forecasting, tax estimation, and has record keeping capability for all
    forms of assets and liabilities.  YOUR NETWORTH is not a stock port-
    folio manager, a check writer, or a bill payer.  This system provides
    the means by which you can track and manage your accumulation of all
    assets in order to achieve your total financial goals.
    
    Although YOUR NETWORTH is a spreadsheet template for Lotus 1-2-3, very
    little 1-2-3 knowledge or experience is required.  Use it to record
    and manage your financial assets and liabilities such as bank
    accounts, retirement plans, stocks, bonds, mortgages, and other
    personal assets.  You can inventory and analyze anything of value.
    
    You can also use the program to forecast "what if?" financial
    situations.  Its goal seeking capability predicts your future
    financial condition.  You can project how changing monetary
    conditions, inflation rate, investment yields, and personal tax
    liabilities impact your current and future net worth.
    
    YOUR NETWORTH automatically provides help and/or hints if you
    incorrectly enter critical information.
