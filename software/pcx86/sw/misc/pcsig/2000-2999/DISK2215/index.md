## Information about "ZEPHYR 1 OF 2 (2216 ALSO)"

    ZEPHYR is a fully relational, FoxPro-compatible database management
    system for non-programmers. Up to 25 databases can be manipulated
    simultaneously. Its performance is roughly 16 times that of dBase III
    and eight times that of dBase IV. Using a Mac-like interface,
    sophisticated database applications (including reports, labels, lists,
    and form letters) can be designed and generated in minutes, not
    months. ZEPHYR is the perfect database tool for both novice and
    experienced database users.
    
    SPECIAL NOTE: The Shareware version of ZEPHYR is completely
    functional but the accompanying FoxPro run-time supports only 120
    records.
