## Information about "FAMILY TREE JOURNAL 2 OF 2 (1535 ALSO)"

    Imagine having a book that chronicles the history of your family, going
    back generations!  Here's your opportunity to create one for your great,
    great, great grandchildren!
    
    FAMILY TREE JOURNAL provides a convenient way of collecting and
    compiling genealogical and biographical information.  The output of
    this program is a formatted book with information about a virtually
    infinite family history.  Just think, if you could locate the
    information about only your direct ancestors (not including any
    sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, or cousins) for only
    20 generations, you would find you're descended from over
    1,000,000 people and over 500,000 of them would be your great, great,
    great grandparents!
    
    FAMILY TREE JOURNAL takes information you uncover about your relatives
    and creates a document that lets others study the history without a
    computer.  It has easy data entry and collates the information through
    various sort and merge routines into an informative family reference.
    Give copies as unique gifts to family members.  An annual update of the
    book, based on new information accumulated throughout the year, could
    become a family tradition!
