## Information about "WINDOWS ARCADE GAMES I"

    People with happy trigger fingers will love this game.  ATMOIDS is a new
    Windows version of Asteroids.  Your mission is simple, blast the
    boulders away until they get pulverized out of existence.  Your trusty
    interstellar ship is guided with the cursor keys.  This game will
    challenge even the most experienced players, since there is no
    hyper-space key to dodge out of the way at the last second.
    
    You're on the final approach one thousand meters above the moon, do you
    have what it takes to land the Lunar Excursion Module without creating
    another crater?
    
    On this real-time simulation you must safely guide your lander with the
    mouse before you run out of fuel, or accumulate too much horizontal and
    vertical speed.  You can change the settings for gravity, fuel, and
    thrust if you desire another level of difficulty.
    
    KLOTZ is an interesting Tetris clone from Europe.  As in the original
    Tetris, polygons fall from the top of your screen and it's your job to
    pack them neatly at the bottom before they stack up.  It has 11 levels
    of play, optional multi-windowed displays, a look-ahead to the next
    piece, and even a statistical bar-line chart depicting fallen pieces.
    If you've never played this type of game, watch out, it's quite
    addicting.
    
    WINTRIS is another Tetris-like game in which falling blocks must be
    rotated and dropped to form solid lines.  This program has all the
    standard features; you can select the level, number of lines to
    begin with, speed up, slow down, sound, and music.  All these features
    can be preset or changed on the fly.  A unique feature of the game is
    "The Extended Set".  The "Extended Set" is an extra set of block shapes
    not found on any other game.  This feature is worth checking out,
    especially if you have become adept or bored with the same shapes which
    are prevalent in similar games.
