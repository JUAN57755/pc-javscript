## Information about "COST CALCULATION"

    Do you need to determine how much a product should cost your client? Do
    you need to know how much to charge customers for your new widget? If
    you do, then COST CALCULATION will help you. Tabulate activities,
    equipment, labor, indirect equipment, and materials used and arrive at a
    cost to be charged for your new widget or whatever you are manufacturing
    or making.
    
    COST CALCULATION is a program for recording the costs involved in a
    small to large manufacturing and/or construction firm. Its objective is
    to provide itemized overhead costs and costs of each final
    product produced.
    
    Installing the program is easy. Once done, read the manual carefully.
    This is necessary or the program cannot be used properly.
    
    For those in construction or manufacturing, COST CALCULATION is worth
    examining. The shareware version is limited to 20 pieces of equipment,
    60 activities, 400 vouchers, and 10 consumers (not customers). More
    complete printer error checking is provided in the registered version.
