## Information about "SEBFU AND QUICK DIRECTORY"

    Create professional, powerful batch files with SEBFU.  SEBFU permits you
    to improve your batch file menus by giving you the option to control
    the position of text and colors (or monochrome intensity), create
    windows and boxes and to scroll text across the screen.  SEBFU increases
    the potential of your batch files by allowing you to make decisions
    based upon your system configuration.  Error levels are returned which
    indicate configurations such as presence of ANSI.SYS, disk drives,
    memory usage, mouse driver, printer status, cursor location, keyboard
    type and much more!  SEBFU is a must for software developers or those
    who want to greatly improve the efficiency and power of their batch
    files.
    
    SEBFU also includes the Business Control System (BCS), a simple
    telephone log database/telecommunications program.  BCS dials your
    number, records who you called, the time and date, as well as any
    messages.  BCS is easy to learn and is a handy organizational tool.
    
    SEBFU includes 51 batch utilities, plus BCS.  You can receive an
    additional 49 batch utilities with registration.
    
    QUICK DIRECTORY makes the chore of cleaning up your disk storage space
    easy and fun. File commands such as copy, erase, make directory,
    locate, compare, rename and sort on date, size, name or extension are
    available at the touch of a key. Handle multiple files with one
    command. The commands are loaded with conformations and messages that
    makes them almost foolproof.
    
    The copy command can accept two different targets or copy to the same
    target repeatedly. By using the mark and copy commands, selective
    backup is available. If you want to backup only changed files, you can
    do so with one copy command. Copy will even skip a file too big to fit
    on the disk and copy another, smaller file already marked for backup.
    
    The QUICK DIRECTORY display can show time and date, summarize disk
    information, provide help for the function keys, and display different
    directories on the left and right sides of the screen. The typical
    directory entry is altered to indicate file attributes such as
    read-only, archive, system, or hidden files. Files that have been
    copied or erased are identified, allowing for easier tracking during
    the session.
    
    The instruction manual is complete and includes examples for easier
    learning. QUICK DIRECTORY assumes the user possesses a familiarity
    with DOS file maintenance commands.
