## Information about "SHOOTING GALLERY"

    SHOOTING GALLERY is a colorful arcade game with several different
    levels to test your shooting skill.
    
    Try your luck with traditional CARNIVAL SHOOTING.  With 13 targets to
    test your aim.  Shoot a whole row and get special points.  Next is
    SKEET SHOOTING.  Good aim is needed for this one.  QUICK DRAW is the
    third round.  Shoot when you get the green light.  You'll need fast
    reflexes to get a good score here.
    
    The program features practice for individual rounds, a hall of fame for
    high scores, and statistics for each round.  A mouse is required to play
    this trigger-happy game.
