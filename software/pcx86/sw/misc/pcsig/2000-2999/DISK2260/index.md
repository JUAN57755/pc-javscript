## Information about "SHAREDEBATE INTERNATIONAL #2"

    This shareware disk magazine has taken the world by storm -- after one
    issue, it is being distributed by 425 shareware dealers in 25
    countries.  The magazine is a quarterly debate forum for PC users
    concerned about the present and future.
    
    Ben Bova, author and former editor of OMNI and ANALOG, wrote:
    ``Electronic publishing is here!  SHAREDEBATE INTERNATIONAL is a bold,
    exciting venture that deserves the attention and support of everyone
    who seeks to create a better tomorrow.''
    
    Issue two introduces four new debate topics and Ben Bova contributes!
    New topics:  Supreme Court's 3/27/90 ruling that the majority of
    voluntary assemblies do not have free speech rights;  Entrepreneurial
    Democracy;  Futuristic currency systems to fight drug abuse; A private
    insurance plan for S&L depositors.  Includes a built-in note-
    processor.
    
    A unique commission/subscription feature is built into SHAREDEBATE
    INTERNATIONAL to encourage people to distribute, participate, and
    profit from it.
