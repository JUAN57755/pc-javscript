## Information about "TELIX"

    This is a powerful communications program designed to meet the needs of
    almost any user.  Features include a large range of built-in file
    transfer protocols, such as Zmodem, Compuserve Quick B, Xmodem,
    Xmodem-1k, Xmodem-1k-g, Ymodem (TRUE), Ymodem-g, Kermit, SEAlink,
    Telink, Modem7, and ASCII.  Up to four "external" protocols can be
    defined and called from within TELIX, making almost any kind of file
    transfer possible.
    
    Multiple dialing directories hold up to 1000 entries each.  Also
    provided are: automatic queue redialing for hard-to-reach numbers, DEC
    VT100 and VT52 terminal emulation, full access to DOS including a DOS
    shell, a host mode, a chat mode, and even an extensive SALT script
    language to allow TELIX to perform automated logons. As an example of
    the power of script files, the TELIX Host Mode is written in the SALT
    script language.
