## Information about "GRAND PRIX"

    Manage your own racing team!  During the race season you're in charge
    of finances, hiring and firing of drivers, design staff and mechanics.
    You must also purchase cars, engines, and other items necessary for a
    successful season.  Since you start out as rookie team manager you have
    a limited amount of money with which to put together the best team
    possible.
    
    Once you have a completed team it's time to start your engine. There are
    16 races in the season and you must try to qualify for each. With a
    skillful driver you may win a race. With a good chief mechanic you could
    win more. If you have an experienced chief designer your car may last
    the whole season. And if you manage to put all the parts together, the
    championship awaits you.
    
    If you have ever wanted to be like Roger Penzske and manage a racing
    team GRAND PRIX is made for you!
