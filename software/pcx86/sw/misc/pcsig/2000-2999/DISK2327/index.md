## Information about "CAVES OF THOR"

    On an expedition far within the icy mountains of Norway you discover a
    crevice leading deep into the jagged rock.  You find yourself
    within a vast underground empire--an enormous network of caves,
    passages and chambers.  Local legends reveal that a famous mythological
    deity once ruled these peaks, could you have stumbled across the
    mystical ruler's kingdom?  You decide to find out....
    
    CAVES OF THOR is a brilliant 16 color arcade/graphics game with a 4-way
    scrolling playfield. You'll need to explore seven huge levels for the
    three Symbols of Virtue.  These three virtues are needed to finish
    CAVES OF THOR.
    
    As you explore the empire you must overcome the many creatures that
    patrol it.  Use your gun (unlimited bullets) to shoot creatures and
    creature generators.  Other hazards include underground flowing streams
    (with currents that can drag you away!), bubbling lava pits and lakes,
    and the very dangerous Thor Beast, which creates creatures with
    devastating speed.
    
    This program features some of the best music yet heard in a shareware
    game. Other notable features include a save/restore option, easy
    keyboard controls, a demonstration mode, permanent high score, and an
    easy playing cheat mode!
    
    For those players looking for a game similar to the Kroz games... this
    is it.
