## Information about "TIMESTAX"

    TIMESTAX is a personal time management tool like Timeslips-III, Time
    Card, and Timesheet. This low-cost time management program allows one
    or more users to systematically record and summarize time spent doing
    work.
    
    Timecards are entered specifying user-defined clients, projects, and
    tasks along with the date, time, and an optional 8-line note
    describing the activity. The user fully controls the level of summary
    detail in a wide variety of management reports. Other features
    include an automatic timer to clock any given activity; flexible
    export, archive, and backup of timecards; on-line help screens; full
    report selection and sorting criteria; sublists of projects and tasks
    specific to each client; up to 100 employees per database; and LAN
    compatibility.
    
    By simplifying the important features and eliminating the less
    essential features, TIMESTAX offers full functionality at a lower price
    than the competition. Since most users will spend less than 20 minutes
    a week running the program, TIMESTAX relies on a simple intuitive
    interface that takes only 10 minutes to learn.
