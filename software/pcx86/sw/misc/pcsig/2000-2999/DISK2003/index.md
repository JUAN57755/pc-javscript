## Information about "SERIAL FILE COPY"

    SERIAL FILE COPY allows the transfer of files between any two IBM-PC
    compatible computers equipped with standard serial ports.  SFC is
    particularly useful in copying files between PCs with 5.25" disks and
    those with 3.5" disks, such as the IBM PS/2 and the various IBM-PC
    compatible laptops.

    ~ COM1 through COM4 ports are supported
    
    ~ Baud rates of 1200, through 38400 may be selected
    
    ~ Select groups of files with DOS wildcards
    
    ~ Select entire directories
    
    ~ Complete disk and transfer status on screen
    
    ~ On-line help provided for all SFC commands
    
    ~ Full 16-bit CRC checksum is used
    
    ~ Bad file packets are automatically retransmitted
    
    ~ Supports command line parameters
