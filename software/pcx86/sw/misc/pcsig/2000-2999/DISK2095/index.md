## Information about "VIRUSCAN, VSHIELD, AND CLEAN-UP"

    Stop viruses in their tracks!  VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire
    systems for known viruses, identifies the intruder, removes the virus,
    and often repairs any damage to the system.
    
    VIRUSCAN looks for any preexisting PC virus infection.  Over 95
    different virus strains and numerous sub-varieties for each strain can
    be identified by this program.  These viruses include the ten most
    common viruses that account for over 95% of all reported PC infections.
    The documentation lists all the viruses by name (and what a list), for
    example:  "The Do-Nothing Virus, Lisbon Virus, Ghost Virus-Ghostball,
    New Jerusalem, Disk Killer-Ogre, Dark Avenger, 1514- Datacrime II,
    Icelandic-II, and the Pakistani Brain, to name a few.
    
    It indicates the specific files or system areas infected and identifies
    the virus strain that's caused the infection.  Removal can then be done
    automatically, or as a separate step.
    
    The memory resident version of VIRUSCAN, VSHIELD prevents viruses from
    getting into your system in the first place.  It monitors and scans
    programs as they're loaded and prevents infected programs from
    executing.  It also scans specific areas of the system -- the boot
    sector, partition table, hidden files, command interpreter and itself,
    when it is first executed.  It's your first line of defense against
    virus attacks.
    
    The last in VIRUSCAN's trilogy of defense, CLEAN-UP kills
    and removes computer viruses, and in most instances, repairs infected
    files, reconstructs damaged programs and returns the system to normal
    operation.  It works for all viruses identified by the current version
    of VIRUSCAN.
    
    CLEAN-UP searches the entire system looking for the virus that you wish
    to remove.  When found, the infected file is identified, the virus is
    isolated and removed, and for the more common viruses, the infected file
    is repaired.  If the file is infected with a less common virus that
    can't be separated from the file, the infected
    file is wiped from the disk and deleted from the system.
