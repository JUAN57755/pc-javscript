## Information about "RAMBASE ACCOUNTING"

    Fast, faster, fastest are ways to describe this program. RAMBASE
    ACCOUNTING is run completely within RAM and you can tell the difference
    in speed quickly. To be sure, data is saved to disk, but only when you
    request it. Consequently, data can be lost more easily than with other
    programs, but with a little practice this can be overcome.
    
    There are absolutely no delays to be found in the program.
    State-of-the-art technology is used to sort, index and merge all the
    necessary data at keystroke speed. Switching is easy. You can go
    between payables, receivables, inventory, checkbook, point-of-sale and
    reports simply by pressing a key. Each task is simply suspended until
    you return to it. In addition, invoices can be produced and printed
    quickly, which is something that many other accounting programs only
    dream about.
    
    It is suggested that the user read the manual to understand some of the
    ways the program has been organized. For instance, accounts are
    accessed by their names rather than by an account number as in most
