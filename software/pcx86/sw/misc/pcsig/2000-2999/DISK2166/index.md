## Information about "COIN COLLECTOR'S DATABASE"

    Coin collections can be fun. But if you need information on one of
    your coins, it's usually quite a chore. Not with the COIN COLLECTOR'S
    DATABASE.
    
    COIN COLLECTOR'S DATABASE is capable of recording up to one million
    entries tracking the type of coin, year and place of mint, condition
    and quantity minted; face value; present value and country of mint --
    all with a couple of keystrokes. Once entered, you'll never have to
    thumb through a coin folder again. The system will report on the
    status of your collection just as easily.
    
    COIN COLLECTOR'S DATABASE comes with a sample file of coins,
    context-sensitive help screens to assist you in finding your way around
    and, as a bonus, a text file viewer to ease documentation reading.
