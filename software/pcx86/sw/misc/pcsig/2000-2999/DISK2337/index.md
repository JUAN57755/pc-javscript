## Information about "PC ASSEMBLER HELPER & TUTOR #1 (& 2338)"

    The PC ASSEMBLER TUTOR is an assembler tutorial that covers all 8086
    instructions.  Starting with the simplest instructions, it works its
    way through the whole instruction set.  TUTOR also covers details of
    the hardware involved with the 8086.
    
    The PC ASSEMBLER HELPER (ASMHELP.OBJ) is an object file which does I/O
    for assembler-level routines. It also displays the 8086 registers and
    flags, if desired, and allows each arithmetic register to be
    independently formatted.
    
    The intended users are people who are already competent programmers in
    a high-level language and either are just starting to learn assembler,
    or know fewer than 60% of the assembler mnemonics and want to learn
    more. TUTOR assumes that the user has a general knowledge of the DOS
    commands, subdirectory structure, and pathnames. It is also helpful if
    the user has already linked object modules to form an executable file.
    
    This is the only manual on the market that systematically covers the
    assembler mnemonics system, allows easy input and output of data at the
    assembler level, and allows you to see the arithmetic registers in the
    way they are being used.
