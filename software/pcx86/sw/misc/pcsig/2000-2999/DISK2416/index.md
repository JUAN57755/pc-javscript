## Information about "DAYO EOP (END OF PERIOD)"

    DAYO EOP (END OF PERIOD PACK & INVENTORY) contains routines that are
    normally run at the end of a reporting period. DAYO EOP permits you to
    permanently remove deleted records from the Accounts Receivable (AR) and
    Accounts Payable (AP) databases, and to erase old report text files.
    There is also a routine for performing a physical inventory. Many
    reports are included (i.e., AR ageing, AP summary, inventory
    movement).
