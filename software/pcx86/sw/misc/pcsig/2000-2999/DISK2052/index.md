## Information about "MULTIBAK AND FINDZZ"

    MULTIBAK makes computer tasks requiring multiple file changes less
    frustrating and safer from disaster. Many programs, such as
    wordprocessors, database managers, and spreadsheets, provide for a
    single generation of backup, usually renaming the old version of
    "filename.ext" to "filename.bak" before writing a new "filename.ext" to
    disk. When a new revision is again saved, the old version again becomes
    "filename.bak," wiping out the backup file saved earlier.
    
    But what if we change our minds about a major revision and need to
    return the document or spreadsheet to its state several generations
    earlier? Or if we later discover a major error and the loss of earlier
    versions could seriously set our work back? MULTIBAK allows for
    creation of backups whenever significant changes are made, accumulating
    them until a final version is completed and verified. MULTIBAK allows
    sequential creation of up to 99 backup versions of a file. These backup
    files can be conveniently erased later using the PURGE program.
    
    FINDZZ locates misplaced files in the blink of an eye! Use wildcard
    characters to find files created at specified dates and times. FINDZZ
    is much faster than DOS because FINDZZ creates a disk index which
    allows for speedy access of up to 300 subdirectories.
    
    FINDZZ consists of four easy to use screens: "find files;" "found
    files"; "selected file"; and "configuration file." Indicate search
    criteria in the "find files" screen, then see the list of files found in
    the "Files Found" screen. Highlight one of the found files, press
    return and the "selected file" screen allows you to edit this file using
    your text editor. Up to eight of your programs can be added to the
    "selected file" screen program menu. FINDZZ is convenient, and it's a
    great time saver for any hard disk owner!
