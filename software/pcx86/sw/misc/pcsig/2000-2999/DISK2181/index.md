## Information about "PC-NAMES"

    Tired of looking through your little black book only to find the
    numbers have faded or are so messy you have no idea what they are?
    Well, you're in luck!  PC-NAMES, a combination mail list manager and
    address book program, stores an unlimited number of names and prints
    many mailing label and report formats.  In addition, it prints
    pocket-sized address books in several sizes and styles.  And it even
    prints address books on both sides of the page.
    
    PC-NAMES features a phone dialer, mailing labels, Rolodex cards,
    automatic sequence by name or zip code, five report formats,
    envelopes, automatic vertical address centering and blank line
    suppression, large five-line address formats, personal and business
    name formats, hot key for individual label or envelope printing, two
    phone numbers per name, portable pocket-size address book, mail merge
    with five levels of salutation defaults, export, import, categories for
    grouping names, duplicate search, documentation on disk,
    user-defined custom label sizes, and support for dot matrix, laser, and
    impact printers.
