## Information about "CRAFTY LI'L HELPER"

    Here's a home business system that lets you concentrate on your
    craft, not your paperwork.  Its menu system guides you painlessly
    through tracking costs, supplies, customers, and products counted.
    
    The lure of running a business, making some extra money, or helping
    with a charity, has overcome all of us at one time or another.  So what
    went wrong?  We didn't have CRAFTY LI'L HELPER doing all the hard work!
    This is a very crafty helper, and the only thing that's
    "little" about it is its registration fee.  Among its features is an
    easy-to-use menu system that guides you painlessly through inventory
    and invoicing, sales tax, and UPS shipping rates.
    
    CRAFTY LI'L HELPER keeps track of your inventory size and cost; tracks
    your retail, wholesale and consignment customers; and follows all
    outstanding orders and billing.  Although it can run on just one
    floppy drive, its record number is limited only by your disk storage
    size.  With CRAFTY LI'L HELPER, all of the really difficult parts of
    running your own small business have been taken care of, and you're
    left with all the fun!
    
    CRAFTY LI'L HELPER is a big help for small businesses with items to
    sell.  It carefully shows where money is spent and how much has been
    made.  Plus, it is very easy to use, with clear instructions on moving
    around in the program and encouraging words when you make a sale!
    Especially if you are going into a craft business, take along CRAFTY
    LI'L HELPER.
