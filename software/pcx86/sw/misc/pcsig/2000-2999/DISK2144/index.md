## Information about "JIGSAW MANIA"

    Jigsaw puzzle fans rejoice!  JIGSAW MANIA provides colorful fun for all
    who enjoy the challenge of a good jigsaw puzzle by scrambling an image
    on your screen and asking you to piece it back together.
    
    You set the difficulty level by dividing the puzzle into a few big
    pieces or lots of little square pieces.  The program mixes the pieces
    up and you put them back together.  That may sound easy, but you know
    better.
    
    JIGSAW MANIA counts the number of moves it takes to complete the
    puzzle.  The shareware version contains two different puzzles, while
    athe registered version contains twelve.  The puzzles are great for
    either childrem or adults, simply just adjust the level of difficulty.
    
    Don't worry about not having time to finish the puzzle.  JIGSAW MANIA
    has a feature that lets you save the puzzle at any point and come back
    to it later.  Not only is it fun, but it sure saves a lot of space on
    the dining room table.
