## Information about "APEX STOCKS & OPTIONS DISK 2 OF 2 (2044)"

    If you own any stocks and want to stay up with the daily or weekly
    information, then APEX may be what you are looking for.  This program
    will assist any investor in examining, analyzing, comparing, plotting or
    charting their stocks, bonds, funds, and more.  APEX S/O will let you
    analyze any stocks or options using the popular high-low-close bar
    format with volume displayed below the price.  If you have stock files,
    the data will be kept in individual files with high, low, close, and
    volume value for each day.
    
    APEX lets you create strategies using single or double moving averages,
    based on buying long, selling short, or both.  A valuable feature is the
    charting of optimization trials, allowing you to see the most effective
    choices for short and long term moving averages.  If you have option
    files, open interest will also be stored in the file.
    
    There is no registration fee, no start-up fee, but there is a per quote
    fee.  You can enter your own data or download it by modem from Warner
    Computer Systems, Inc.  There is a sample database on disk two of this
    program, allowing some initial experimentation.
    
    The program is easy to use, easy to set up, and useful.  The manual
    explains how to use the program but does not train the novice in
    learning the "markets game."
