Disk Title: The Animated Alphabet 2/2 (#2831 also)                      
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: The Animated Alphabet                                    
Author Version: 4/90                                                    
Author Registration: $7.95                                              
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, EGA, and a hard drive.                  
                                                                        
THE ANIMATED ALPHABET combines colorful graphics with appealing         
animation to teach children the letters of the alphabet. After choosing 
the correct letter for the graphic shown, for example a monkey, the     
monkey starts jumping around and the word "monkey" is written near the  
bottom of the screen. This is a fun program designed to hold the        
attention of children preschool to the first grade, more than worth the 
author's modest registration fee.
