## Information about "THE CHECKBOOK"

    Tired of manually balancing your checkbook and trying to keep track of
    your charge accounts and budgets? Let THE CHECKBOOK free you from this
    drudgery. It's a menu-driven money management system designed for
    family or small business usage where the accounting system is based on
    checking accounts. The maximum amount of money that can be handled is
    $999,999.99.
