## Information about "GENESIS: SERIES II 1 OF 2 (2243 ALSO)"

    Turn your computer into a check-writing machine with GENESIS: SERIES
    II. It's an easy-to-use home check writing program. So simple, in fact,
    that anyone who now maintains a checkbook by hand already knows the
    basics. The display screens even look just like your checkbook --right
    down to the names on the checks.
    
    GENESIS automatically does all the calculations that you do now hand,
    but it won't make any mistakes. Balance your checkbook in a fraction of
    the usual time, and if you are out of balance, it will help you find
    and correct the error. Print your checks, configured to your specific
    printer. You don't even need special checks -- the check on the screen
    will look similar to the one you are using.
    
    Keep track of tax deductions or anything else that you want to
    categorize. Search for a check written months ago with only the barest
    of information, and then get a report on the findings. Checks that you
    write to the same companies over and over will be kept in memory, ready
    to be used at the push of a key. Tired of addressing envelopes? The
    program does it for you. To keep prying eyes out, give GENESIS a
    password and your checkbook is locked. There is also multiple
    checkbook support.
