## Information about "FILE/ARCHIVE"

    At last, a self-activating utility for analyzing and archiving files on
    a hard disk. Using criteria set by the user, the system looks for files
    which may no longer be active and offers the user the opportunity to
    either remove them completely or archive (move) them from their current
    location. Technically a hard disk is not required, but the system's
    value is in its ability to scan large amounts of data and automatically
    select data needing attention.
    
    To use the system, pre-select directories to be periodically analyzed.
    A master configuration record tells FILE/ARCHIVE how often to look at
    directory entries to see whether they should be analyzed. By including
    the proper command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the system can be made
    totally automatic. The only thing it will not do automatically is
    actually archive files -- it merely presents the files that meet the
    selection criteria in a menu and asks if you would like to archive or
    delete any of them. Any files that are selected are then moved to a
    designated archive location, usually a floppy disk.
    
    Customize several parameters such as a variety of default values,
    specify whether to include system or hidden files in the analysis
    (although it won't allow you to archive such files as long as they have
    those attributes), specify whether or not to use DOS' Write
    Verify feature, assign your own function keys, and more.
