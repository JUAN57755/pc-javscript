## Information about "PARCEL SHIPPING PROGRAM (2319 ALSO)"

    The PARCEL SHIPPING PROGRAM (PSP) is a menu-driven system that meets
    all UPS reporting requirements. It is designed to eliminate the
    tedious UPS paperwork needed to ship parcels.
    
    All UPS shipping rates and tables are included. As you enter the
    shipping transaction, PSP calculates the UPS zone shipping charges.
    Produce shipping labels, COD tags, and UPS manifests. PSP maintains a
    shipping address file for frequently shipped-to customers, and a
    temporary file for one-time shipments that can be deleted at the end of
    the day. The format of the shipping data entry screen is similar to the
    UPS log book, making PSP very easy to use.
