## Information about "POWER LABEL"

    Print custom-designed labels, envelopes, and index cards.
    
    For printing jobs where the size of the item is unusual, there is an
    "All-purpose" mode, with no restrictions on dimensions or spacing,
    allowing customization. Some features include:
    
    ~ Custom print styles for each line by using any combination of the 12
    print modes available: draft, elite, compressed, horizontally
    expanded, vertically expanded, subscript, italics, underlined,
    emphasized, doublestrike, letter quality, and proportional printing.
    
    ~ The ability to change print styles on  any line at any time.
    
    ~ Editing of line text.
    
    ~ File-saving option for storing label/envelope/card data on disk for
    later use.
    
    ~ DOS shell.
    
    Designed for use with Epson FX-compatible printers, but most
    near-compatible printers will work with all of POWER LABEL's features.
