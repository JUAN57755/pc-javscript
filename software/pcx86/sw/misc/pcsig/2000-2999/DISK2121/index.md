## Information about "SHAREDEBATE INTERNATIONAL"

    one issue, it is being distributed by 425 shareware dealers in 25
    countries!
    
    The magazine is a quarterly debate forum for PC users concerned about
    the present & future.  Ben Bova, author & former editor of OMNI &
    ANALOG, wrote: "Electronic publishing is here!  ShareDebate
    International is a bold, exciting venture that deserves the attention &

    forums established in this first issue deal with a National Interest
    Project-Level Stock Market; Occupational Representation vs Geographical
    Representation for Voter Districting; Computer Modeling Future Cities to
    Fight the Greenhouse Effect and Strengthen the Economy; Japanese vs U.S.
    Patent Law; Economic Impact of Corporate Income Tax; and the Existing

    International to encourage people to distribute, participate, and profit
