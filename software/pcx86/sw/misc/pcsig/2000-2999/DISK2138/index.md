## Information about "ANOTHER LIFELESS PLANET & ME WITH NOBEER"

    NOBEER is a logical adventure game. It's a big one, too, created with
    the Gamescape adventure game generation system. The response has been
    incredible. If you like adventure gaming, this is a must have! In
    NOBEER, the player is an astronaut stranded on a hostile alien planet
    (sound familiar? Players of Marooned Again will recognize the character
    immediately). The goal: find a way to get to an alien space ship and rig
    it to blast off to safety. That's easier said than done; as the
    astronaut you will face perils such as deadly slurpers, air squids,
    bladderbeasts and the terrible pun palm tree!
    
    Unlike many adventure games, ANOTHER LIFELESS PLANET AND ME WITH NO
    BEER is completely logical. Everything in the game has a reason (well,
    maybe) and everything you do has a purpose (most of the time) and above
    all, everything is logical (well, to an alien, anyway). This game is
    funny too. Do you know what happens when you eat a frog? Or the only
    way to get past an alien monster?  Have you ever tried to munch a
    slimeball? Do you know what it feels like when you try to pick up
    slime? What does a dead astronaut's head look like? You'll find all
    this out in ANOTHER LIFELESS PLANET AND ME WITH NO BEER.
