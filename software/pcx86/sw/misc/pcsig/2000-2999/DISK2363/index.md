## Information about "ROOTDIRECTORY-FLOWERS #2 (2362,2364)"

    Successful gardening is no longer dependent on the use of a green
    thumb. With ROOTDIRECTORY-FLOWERS, even novice gardeners can produce
    beautiful flowers and shrubs, ideally suited to the environment.
    
    ROOTDIRECTORY-FLOWERS is a new kind of communications tool. Using
    hypertext (hot buttons) and expert knowledge, it lets the personal
    computer become a medium to communicate ideas and information to
    others.
    
    The uses for ROOTDIRECTORY-FLOWERS are many. For example, in a
    nursery, complex gardening information can be effectively communicated
    to customers and new employees. Plant material, pest control, sales
    aids, and staff training are a few of the areas that can benefit from
    this system.
    
    For individuals, ROOTDIRECTORY-FLOWERS offers an exciting new
    possibility. You don't have to decipher complex information from a wide
    variety of gardening books any more. Select the growing zone, blooming
    season, plant form and color, growing situation, plant type, and height.
    It searches its knowledge base of more than 400 flower species and
    varieties to find the flowers that best meet your needs. The
    information, while accessible to beginners, can get very technical and
    advanced.
