            W E L C O M E    T O    W O R L D    E M P I R E



          There you stand: alone, confident.
          The building whose baroque balcony rails you are gripping
      is a massive structure - actually the capital building of
      your country.  You gaze up at the clear, azure sky, then
      downwards to the skyline of your beautiful capital city.  A
      humbling aura of history clouds your thoughts - but not your
      vision - as you further lower your gaze to the city streets
      below.
          There is a noise rising from there.
          Rather, there is a thunder rising!
          Incredibly, as far as your eyes can see, the streets,
      boulevards, byways, and even alleyways of your city are
      packed with the people responsible for your rise to power as
      their supreme leader.  Masses of loyal, idealistic faces
      return your gaze as they voice their approval of your mission
      with long, loud, appreciative cheers!

          Your mission?  Not less than to conquer the entire planet
      and institute a worldwide government under the auspices of
      your beloved ideology.

          World Empire is a strategy game based on a time in the
      not too distant future when nationalism is on the decline.
      The people of the world are tired of the weakened nationalist
      governments that are constantly bickering with one another
      over trade restrictions and border disagreements.
          The beliefs of the world population have polarized into
      two to four ideologies (depending on the number of players in
      the game!).
          Each ideology has a strong, determined leader who
      considers himself to be militarily capable of uniting the
      bworld under one government.
          Here is a brief summary of the four major ideologies and
      their leaders:


      The Populist Movement

              It has been 10 years since the Populist movement
          swept like wildfire around the world. Growing out of the
          democratic movement that sprang up in Europe during the
          late 1980's, it was carried by enthusiastic students,
          artists, and intellectuals who organized rallies,
          protests, and marches.
              Their enthusiasm led to the overthrow of a number of
          governments. Local populations joined them and the
          populist flag became synonymous with youth.  They have a
          dynamic leader who has promised that one day they will
          cover the whole world.  He has raised a number of armies
          of his own and rumor has it that he plans to take over
          leadership of other populist countries as well as defeat
          the three other world parties .


      The Militarist Ideology
              Disgruntled army leaders executed rapid coups in a
          number of African countries during the last years of the
          20th century. The subsequent success of the economies of
          those countries led to growing support for military
          leadership in other nations.
              A fiery young army officer in Morocco rose rapidly to
          the rank of general and his charismatic personality has
          generated a great deal of followers who regard him as a
          potential world leader. The Militarist ideology bears
          close watching in future years.


      The Socialist Ideology

              Socialists owe their beginnings to a group of Central
          American countries who amalgamated in 2004 and formed a
          coalition promoting world unity as a means for better
          distribution of national resources.  Opposition in their
          home territory has, at times, tipped the balance of power
          and ousted them.
              However, their ideology has aroused a lot of support
          among some countries.  At present the most powerful
          exponent of it, both militarily and philosophically is a
          highly educated young general noted for his military
          campaigns and his best selling book Share The Wealth or
          Lose It.  Some critics feel that his world unity plans
          call for one leader, himself!


      The Realists

              Many people don't remember the obscure beginnings of
          the Realist ideology.  Apparently, it started in a small
          village in eastern Canada, known as Pugwash Junction, by
          a frustrated smoker who felt that cigarette taxes were
          too high.  He organized thousands of disgruntled smokers
          who overthrew the government and dropped cigarette prices
          from $6.46 a pack to 25 cents.  Gradually, the push for
          realistic prices spread to other things.
              The present head of the Realist Party can't remember
          what happened next; but it must have been quite a bit
          since the Realists are determined to take over the world
          with their leader, a grandchild of the original Pugwash
          Junction revolter (and a non-smoker!).

          Can you do it?  Can you defeat the other ideological
      bleaders and create your own empire?
          Or, if you haven't anyone else to conquer, can you defeat
      bthe evil General - 'Chip' Silicon - in Computer Play Mode?
          What are REVOLUTIONS?
          World Empire will provide the answers to these questions
      and give you hours of enjoyable hegemony!


          Enjoy!  "May you always occupy fully".

Object of Game:
---------------
   To conquer the world and bring it under your ideology and
leadership!  For ideas see Strategies below.



Program Requirements:
---------------------
      - An EGA or VGA Graphics card with 256k on board

      - An IBM or Compatible Computer with 512k Memory

      - MicroSoft Compatible Mouse (Optional)



Mouse Users:      -  In general, anywhere in the instructions that the <ENTER>
                     or <SPACEBAR> keys are mentioned, you will use the LEFT       
                     MOUSE BUTTON.                
                  -  When there is a reference to the <ESC> key, use the
                     RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
                  -  When there is a reference to the <F1> key, DOUBLE-CLICK
                     the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
                  -  For the movement of the Game Selection Indicators (the
                     SWORD and the large purple ARROW), only the up and down
                     motion of the mouse is read by the program.
                  -  Throughout the following text, special notes will appear
                     where Mouse functions differ from keyboard functions.





Starting World Empire (hard disk):

   Copy all files provided on the program floppy disks into an
appropriately named directory on your hard drive.   Your program
disks should contain the following files:

      AFRICA      CNT       2739  bytes
      ASIA        CNT       4605                      
      AUSTRALI    CNT        393
      EUROPE      CNT       1721
      NORTHAM     CNT       3200
      SOUTHAM     CNT       1488
      EMPIRE      EXE     258034
      ACOORDS     VBL        284
      ATTACKS     VBL       1278
      BIGALPH     VBL       4280
      BORDERS     VBL         72
      CONTINEN    VBL        246
      COUNTRY     VBL       3195
      PAINT       VBL        968
      RESOURCE    VBL     184042
      SMLALPH     VBL       4280
      VINDEX      VBL       1824


   Make sure you are in the directory where all of the files
included with World Empire have been copied. Now type "EMPIRE"
at the DOS prompt and press <ENTER>.  After the title screen
appears (the one with the globe!), press the <ENTER> key on your
keyboard to begin. A window will pop up offering the you the
choices: Start New Empire, or Load A Saved Game.  If you haven't
any saved games you wish to load, use the <ARROW KEYS> to move
the Sword over the button beside START NEW EMPIRE and press
<ENTER>.

   You will be asked to enter the number of players.  World Empire
can be played by 1 to 4 players.  If a one player game is
selected, game play will take place against the computer.

   Each player will then be asked to enter their name. Throughout
the game, the program will refer to each player by their name
prefaced with "General", so be sure to enter your name with this
in mind!  

   MOUSE NOTE:     The Mouse Text Entry Window

                  If you would like to use the mouse for input, press
                  the RIGHT BUTTON when the flashing input cursor is
                  displayed.  A special window for mouse text entry will
                  pop up.  Use the arrow and the Letter Boxes just as
                  you do your fingers and the keyboard.  When your typing
                  is complete, place the arrow over the little box to
                  the left of the word "DONE", and press the RIGHT BUTTON.
                  The window will disappear, and what you have typed will
                  be displayed in its normal location on the screen.
                  If what you typed appears acceptable, press the RIGHT
                  BUTTON again to continue.  Otherwise, pressing the LEFT
                  BUTTON will bring back the mouse entry window so you can
                  edit what was entered.

   After entering their name, each player selects an ideology that
appeals to them - and the flag that corresponds to that
ideology.  That player will keep this ideology throughout the
entire game (Or until he surrenders to an opponent!).


Map Color Menu
--------------
   Next, a selection of map colors is offered.  Use the <ARROW
KEYS> to place the Arrow on your choice and press <ENTER>.
Depending on the colors chosen, each player is assigned a color
to which any country he conquers will change.


Bon Voyage Screen
-----------------
   At this point, a screen will be displayed allowing each player
to view their "portrait", as well as the name of their "Kicking
Off" country (starting position).




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Playing The Game
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   After the Startup procedure, the GLOBAL MAP of the world is
drawn.  Each player's home country will be painted in his or her
own color and their flag will fly high over that country. A
window with the name of the player who will play first appears
informing them that this is their turn.  Press <ENTER> and this
window is replaced by a large purple Arrow.  Before beginning game
play, we'll explain the Game Option Menu selections.  Move the
Arrow (using the <ARROW KEYS>) to the small flag displayed in
the lower left-hand corner of the Global Map.  This flag serves
two purposes: as a constant reminder of whose turn it is; and
as the button for the Game Option Menu.

   Press <ENTER> with the Arrow over this flag and the Game Option
Menu will pop up.

      NOTE: You can also pull up the Game Option Menu by pressing
            the <ESC> key when you are viewing the Global Map.

   There are seven options which can be selected from the Game
Option Menu.  They are:      
  
      1. Exit Empire

      2. Surrender

      3. Sound On/Off

      4. Blitzkrieg Mode On/Off

      5. Save Game

      6. Load Game

      7. About Empire


   A brief explanation of each selection follows:


Exit Empire Option
------------------
   Choose this option to End the game.  Remember to save the game
if you wish to continue at a later date.


Surrender Option
----------------
   Choose this option only if you find there is no hope of
winning.  You may surrender to any of your opponents.  When a
player voluntarily surrenders, all countries he owns are turned
over to the player he surrenders to. Additionally, any country
whose original ideology was the same as the player who
surrendered - will change to the ideology of the player to whom
he surrendered.


Sound Option
------------
   Choose this option to turn the sound on and off.  If the sound
is on when this option is selected, it will be turned off.  If
the sound is off, it will be turned on.  At the beginning of
the game sound is ON.


Blitzkrieg Mode Option
----------------------
   This option is used to speed up the attack process. Setting it
to "On" will cause all Automatic Attack animation sequences to
be suppressed. This can come in handy when high numbers of
armies are engaged in a battle.


Save Game Option
----------------
   Choose this option to SAVE the current game in order to resume
play at a later date.    


Load Game Option
----------------
   Choose this option to LOAD a previously saved game.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           How To Conquer!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   That explains the Game Option Menu, now we'll move on to game
play! Player one: use the <ARROW KEYS> to place the big purple
Arrow over the continent where your home country is located and
press the <ENTER> key.  A large map (the CONTINENTAL MAP) of
that continent will be shown on the screen.  Each player is
given 30 armies to begin their assault. Move the Arrow to your
home country (unless it's already there!).

      NOTE: If you wish to go directly to a country without using
            the arrow keys you may press the first letter of the
            country's name and the arrow will jump to the first
            country whose name begins with that letter.  Continue
            pressing that letter until the arrow is over the country
            you want.

   After selecting your country, press <ENTER> and a menu will
pop up offering you four options:

      1.  Distribute armies

      2.  Attack

      3.  Transfer Armies

      4.  Pass


   An explanation of each option follows:


Distribute Armies Option
------------------------
   This is only done at the beginning of each turn, but the armies
can be distributed into any of the countries owned by the
current player.  All newly recruited armies must be distributed
before game play continues.  The Sword will not move from
"Distribute Armies" until this has been accomplished, nor will
it go to "Distribute Armies" if all new armies have been
distributed.   See the section titled "Transfer Armies" for
detailed instructions on how to use the distribution buttons.

      NOTE: When you are viewing any of the 6 Continental Maps you
            may see a list of the countries bordering the country your
            arrow is on by pressing the <F1> key. This list shows:
            Bordering countries, the number of armies in each country, the
            country's owner (by flag and color), and the country's
            original ideology (by flag).


Attack Option
-------------
   You can only attack a country that borders on your chosen
country.  Place the Sword on this option and press the <ENTER>
key.  A window will appear listing all the countries that border
the country you are attacking from. You may attack any of these
countries (unless you already own them!).  Beside each country
is a flag, a colored block, and another flag.  The first flag
and colored block represent the current owner of that country,
the second flag represents that country's ideology before it was
conquered.  If there is no colored block, it indicates the
country has yet to be conquered.  Place the sword on the button
beside the country you wish to attack and press <ENTER>.  The
Attack Window will pop up.  During an attack the attacker is on
the right side of the screen and the defender is on the left
side of the screen. The winner of each battle is determined by
who has more soldiers or tanks remaining after the battle.  In
the event of a tie the outcome is determined by each country's
ideology.

   If you attack a country which shares your ideology, then you
win the tie, but if you attack a country with a hostile
ideology, they win the tie.  Winners of these individual battles
are determined randomly.  If you are having bad luck you can
break off an attack at any time by using the <ESC> key.  When
you conquer a country, a representative picture of the native
people of that country will appear on the screen.

   If you conquered a country which originally shared your
ideology the people will be smiling and in order to occupy that
country you will need only one army of occupation.

   If the country you've just acquired was originally hostile to
your ideology, then the people will be frowning and you will
need a two to four armies to occupy your new country.

   If you decide to put less than the recommended number of armies
in a country, you are risking REVOLUTION in that country.  A
Revolution can take place at any time during one of the next
your next few turns.  You'll have to decide whether it's worth
the risk.  After a revolution takes place the player of the
original ideology of that country is given control of that
country and is awarded 5 armies to occupy that country.  Avoid
Revolutions!  They waste armies and can give an opponent a
foothold in your territory.


Transfer Armies Option
----------------------
   You may transfer armies from one country to another, but after
you make the transfer your turn is over and the next player's
turn will begin.

   To accomplish the transfer, move the Sword to the button in
front of the "Transfer Armies" selection, and press <ENTER>.  A
window with a list of countries to which you can transfer will
pop up.  Move the Sword to the country you wish to transfer the
armies to, and press <ENTER>.

   Place the Sword on the button beside the (Plus +) sign and
press the <SPACEBAR> to add the armies to their new country.  If
a mistake is made, use <ARROW KEYS> to move the sword to the
button beside the (Minus -) sign and press the <SPACEBAR> to
decrease the armies you added in the new country.


Pass Option

Strategies For Multi-Player Games:
----------------------------------
   Your possible strategies will vary depending on where your home
country is in relation to your opponent's.  Here are a few
suggestions:

   Go For The Throat:

         This strategy involves taking the shortest route to your
         opponent as soon as the game begins.  You then use the armies
         given you for the conquests made along the way and hope they
         make you strong enough to engage your enemy when you arrive!

   Conquer And Fortify:

         This one is usually succesful in earning large numbers of
         armies.   First conquer all of the countries in your present
         continent, then fortify the countries in your continent that
         border other continents.  When you feel your continent is
         sufficiently protected, move on to the next continent you want
         to conquer.   Look at the ideologies of a continent to decide
         whether to take it or not.  Lots of friendly flags are a good
         omen.

   Guerilla Warfare and Subversion:

         Hang back while your opponent conquers his continent, but
         take countries to earn armies while moving closer to his
         countries.  Then, at an opportune moment, you strike.  Focusing
         on countries belonging to him, but that share your ideology,
         take away enough of his occupying armies that a revolution      
         can take place in that country.  If he cannot re-occupy the
         country soon enough, a revolution in that country will give you
         control of it - and five new armies.
         It is a bit risky though!


Strategies For Games With 'Chip' Silicon (the computer):
--------------------------------------------------------
         You're on your own here!  We CAN tell you that 'Chip' prefers
         the Conquer and Fortify Strategy, that he likes masses of
         armies, and that he is single-minded, lacks imagination, and
         dislikes suprises.  Good luck!


Winning The Game:
-----------------
   Any player who loses all his or her countries is forced to
surrender to the player who defeated them.  The player who
defeats all of his/her opponents is declared the winner!


The Emperor's Hall Of Fame:
---------------------------
   The player who defeats the most armies in OFFENSIVE battle is
eligible for the Hall of Fame.

Disk No: 2980
Disk Title: Empire
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Empire
Author Version: 9/91
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: 512K RAM, EGA/VGA, and high density drive. A mouse
                      is optional.

Empire is a different kind of role-playing game.  In it, up to four
people take on roles of dictators and compete to conquer the world. Each
player is given an equal number of armies, and takes turns moving them
from country to country, attacking, and being attacked.  An interesting
twist of this game is that each dictator is assigned a political
idealogy and, as you conquer countries, the occupants may be friendly or
unfriendly. Friendly countries take less troops to occupy, and
unfriendly countries can rebel and throw your troops out.

Use the program's world and continent maps to determine your troop
deployments.  The maps are nicely designed, and you can use a mouse to
move around.  When you want to move or attack, all possible choices are
displayed on pop-up menus for easy selection.  When you do attack, a
window opens up and you see small representations of men and tanks
blowing each other up.  The outcome of any battle is random, with the
dictator having the most armies in the battle favored.

Game design and graphics are well done.  This is a solid version of the
traditional military-strategy game.  You can play one-on-one with the
computer, but that can be a little boring.  The real fun is when you
have more than two human adversaries, and that's when the strategy gets
interesting and challenging.

Military-strategy games have been around a long time, and Empire has put
a pretty face on this traditional game.  It doesn't have the fast action
of an arcade game, but if you're a fan of military-strategy games,
Empire deserves a closer look.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a registration fee to the author. However, if the program does
not fit your needs, there is no obligation to send the registration fee.
It's that simple

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
ensure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and checked every program
submitted to ensure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware affects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
