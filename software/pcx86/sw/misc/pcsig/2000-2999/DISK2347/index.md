## Information about "INDEX MAKER"

    Give your document files that professional touch -- by adding an
    index.  Creating an index to a document is a time-consuming process.
    INDEX MAKER can greatly reduce that investment of time by having your
    computer do the work.  Load the file to be indexed, create a word list
    for the index, and sit back and watch.  INDEX MAKER can index up to 500
    words with a maximum of 50 page citations per word.
    
    INDEX MAKER is menu-driven for ease of operation.  Index word lists can
    be saved on disk and then imported when needed.  Add or delete words
    from existing lists.  Once the index has been created, it can be viewed
    on screen before being sent to the printer.
    
    INDEX MAKER can also be used to locate key words as markers in large
    document files to find information quickly and easily.
