## Information about "ICON DRAW & LISTICO"

    Feeling a little limited by the simple icons on your Windows 3.0 screen?
    Now you can custom create your own 16-color icons to appear in Windows.
    And 11 pre-made icons will help get you started.
    
    With ICONDRAW, you can make your own unique icons depicting the choices
    available from your particular windows environment.  Creating new icons
    can be a snap, especially when using one of the 11 pre-made icons
    included to help get you started.  Once a new icon is saved, you can
    change the icons on the Program Manager by using Windows "properties "
    command.
    
    LISTICO is a small utility that displays Windows icons created with
    Icondraw.  It displays icons alphabetically according to their icon
    names.  This program makes it easier to find an icon in a large library
    of icons.  Two sample icons and source code are included with the
    program.
