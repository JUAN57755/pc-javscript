## Information about "APEX MUTUAL FUNDS DISK 2 OF 2 (2042 ALSO"

    APEX MUTUAL FUNDS allows you to plot and compare any of over 1600 mutual
    funds.  For those active in the market, APEX MUTUAL FUNDS provides a
    means of data access with the added feature of plotting out the
    information easily.
    
    There is no registration fee, no start-up fee, but there is a per quote
    fee.  You can enter your own data or download it by modem from Warner
    Computer Systems, Inc.  There is a sample database on disk two of this
    program, allowing some initial experimentation.
    
    The program is easy to use, easy to set up, and useful.  The manual
    explains how to use the program but does not train the novice in
    learning the "markets game."
