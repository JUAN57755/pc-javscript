## Information about "VAR GRADE 3 OF 3 (903 & 1357)"

    VARGRADE is designed for teachers sho want to keep a computerized record
    of their students' grades.  It tracks an unlimited number of students
    and up to 99 sections of students per class for up to 240 days of
    attendance.  There is no limit to the number of classes.
    
    VAR GRADE supports several grading methods, including weighted exams,
    use of letter or number grades, and the ability to throw out the lowest
    exam score(s).  Several statistical features are also available
    through the program: calculation of mean, median, and mode for exams;
    correlation of two exams; and the ability to sum, average, or take the
    percentage of any combination of exams.  Plot the exam results on your
    printer.
