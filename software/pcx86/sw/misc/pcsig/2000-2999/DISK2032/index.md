## Information about "MPLUS GRAPHIC INTERFACE LIBRARY"

    MPLUS is a graphic interface library for Microsoft C version 5.0 and up.
    If your application generates business or scientific plots, or if you
    need to wrap an interface around an art program or your favorite fractal
    generator, MPLUS will simplify your task.
    
    It provides four basic tools.  The first is a graphic window which can
    display both text and graphics.  The second tool provides three dialogue
    boxes to display a general message, a warning message, and an error
    message.  The third tool is a bar menu with pull down windows.
    Functions and menu titles are easily plugged in.  The bar menu also
    recognizes input from either the mouse or the keyboard. Finally, there
    is mouse support.  These mouse routines are not purely a rehash of the
    mouse interrupt, 33H.  You'll also find an event handler and a function
    which retrieves input from the keyboard and mouse.  The documentation is
    80 pages long and provides a complete reference to all of the functions
    provided.
    
    MPLUS is a user-supported program.  The shareware version contains only
    the small model library, but registration provides the medium, compact,
    and large models, a laser printed manual (double sided and in a Times
    Roman font), two free upgrades, and support via U.S. mail, Compuserve
    and voice mail.
