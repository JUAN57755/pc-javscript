## Information about "INSANITY"

    A huge maze based adventure game where INSANITY rules. Find clues, solve
    puzzles, and try to stay alive in a place where the unexpected is
    common, and pandemonium is found at every turn.
    
    As you try to find the exit from INSANITY you'll encounter many strange
    things.  You'll meet a wizard.  Pass through the stars.  Collect
    ammunition to defend yourself against little red men.  Explore a castle
    and a church along the way.  Play games like seven card challenge or a
    fast paced soccer match.  Most things won't make sense, but if you can
    find a method to the madness, you could find the key to end your search
    for a way out of INSANITY.
