## Information about "THE ELEMENT STUDY AID"

    Having recurring nightmares about flunking your chemistry class?
    Well, we've got good news for you! THE ELEMENT STUDY AID teaches you
    everything you need to know about all of the elements on the
    Periodic Table. Learn the element's name, atomic number and symbol,
    atomic weight, common valence, specific gravity, and the melting
    and boiling points of each. An option on the Periodic Table allows you
    to see where all of the elements fit into it. After you have studied
    the elements or the group of your choosing, run the test
    option to see how well you've learned them.
