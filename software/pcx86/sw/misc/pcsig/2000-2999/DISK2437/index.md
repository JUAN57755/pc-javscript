## Information about "DOUBLE TROUBLE AND NYET"

    Anyone who loves puzzles will spend many hours trying to figure this one
    out!
    
    DOUBLE TROUBLETM is a deceptively simple, yet challenging puzzle for
    young or old.  Starting from a scrambled position, the user rotates two
    intersecting circles of colored balls, grouping them into four color
    groups.  As the color groups are formed, the two intersecting circles
    promptly break up color groups already formed.  Eventually, the balls
    will be grouped into their proper positions, completing the puzzle
    successfully.  Try again, but for a lower score!  The program counts
    each key press taken to move the balls into position.  Help is
    available at a key stroke!
    
    If you haven't yet acquired Tetris, here's your chance to buy a
    "Tetris"-like program through shareware.  The object of the game is to
    pack a 2-dimensional box with block-shaped figures as they come falling
    down from the computer sky.  Try hard not to leave any spaces, but don't
    despair.  You'll get it in time!
    
    This game appeals to both computer game veteran and novice alike (it is
    quite addictive!).  Once you think you're pretty hot stuff, NYET
    challenges you to make the game harder -- drop those blocks faster!  Now
    see what you can do!
