## Information about "POPFORM & NOUVEAU"

    Here's a RAM-resident program that can be called up from within nearly
    any application, grab information from the screen, and merge it into a
    form that you can send to a printer or a disk file.
    
    Unlike the typical single-purpose label or envelope printer, POPFORM is
    actually programmable. Execute subroutines, perform comparisons and
    conditional procedures, and much, much more. It'll even do simple page
    formatting, including margins all around, word wrap, page numbers, and
    one-line headers and footers.
    
    Prepare forms of nearly ANY complexity, as long as the information to
    be plugged into them can be found on your computer's screen.
    
    If you have simple needs, you'll find POPFORM a dream come true. But
    it's nice to know that it also has the power to do heavy-duty chores.
    
    If you're searching for a simple, convenient E-mail system, look no
    further.  This pop-up E-mail system is intended for small Local Area
    Networks (LANs).  It only requires 7K RAM when operating in the
    background and is ideal for sending a quick memo to someone when he's
    out.  When he returns, all he has to do is pop into NOUVEAU and press
    the PgDn key to view each of his new messages.  If installed for use on
    a Novell network, NetWare's broadcast routines will be used to beep the
    destination's workstation whenever a message is sent to it.
