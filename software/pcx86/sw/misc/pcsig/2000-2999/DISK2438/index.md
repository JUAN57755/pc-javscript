## Information about "THE LAST HALF OF DARKNESS"

    Do you like graphic adventure games with sharp pictures, mouse
    support, save and restore game functions, and spine-shivering puzzles
    to solve?  Then THE LAST HALF OF DARKNESS is for you!
    
    When the game starts, you find yourself in front of your recently
    deceased aunt's mansion.  In order to gain the title to her fortune and
    estate, you must find the ingredients to a potion she was working on
    before she was killed.  It won't be easy as there are many strange
    denizens in the old mansion. Some will help you in your quest, while
    others would just as soon finish you off!
    
    Choose one of the listed commands with either the keyboard or mouse.
    Use speaker sound or Covox's Speech Thing.  Examine everything, take
    what you can, and don't forget to save your game before you do
    anything dangerous which, in this game, can be a frequent thing.
    
    What are you waiting for?  Dust those cobwebs off your trusty old map
    notebook and take a journey to THE LAST HALF OF DARKNESS!
