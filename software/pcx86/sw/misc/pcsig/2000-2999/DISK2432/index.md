## Information about "THE LAST WORD"

    Who said ``I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death
    your right to say it.''?  This, and hundreds of other famous
    quotations, are the basis of the trivia game, THE LAST WORD.
    
    Answer questions about quotations by selecting either who said it, why
    it was said, where it was said, or what it was said about.  Your
    answers are matched against a set of acceptable responses with a
    sophisticated pattern-recognition algorithm.  You don't even have to
    spell every name perfectly to receive credit, and bonus points are
    given for quick responses.
    
    While this is not a game for children, it can be used as an
    educational tool for young adults.  Quotations are taken from old
    movies (Garbo, Bogart, etc.), humorists like Robert Orben, songs from
    Gilbert and Sullivan, and writers like Kipling, Nietzsche, Frost,
    Shakespeare, and Hemingway.  (Ans: Voltaire.)
