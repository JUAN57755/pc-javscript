## Information about "SCRAMBLE"

    Scramble plays like a familiar crossword board game of a similar name.
    It features stunning EGA graphics, optional mouse support, and a 33,000
    word dictionary, along with utilities to modify the dictionary or use
    your own dictionary.  Games can be played by one to four human or
    computer players.  If all the players are computer players, Scramble
    will play against itself.
    
    An infinite undo feature is included to let you undo all the words back
    to the first word.  A stats screen allows you to see what letters have
    been played, what words were made, and the point value for each word.
    Scramble can be played at two different skill levels.  You've really got
    to see this one!
