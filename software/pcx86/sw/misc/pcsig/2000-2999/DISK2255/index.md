## Information about "PCBILLING"

    Free yourself from some of the necessary clerical tasks of running a
    small business with PCBILLING.
    
    Using a simple data entry screen, PCBILLING prompts you to enter
    billing information -- who your clients are and what they are being
    billed for, and prints their invoices. Once an invoice is sent,
    PCBILLING remembers it. If payment is not received within 30 days, it
    prints a past-due notice automatically, and if there is no payment
    after 60 days, a delinquent notice is printed.
    
    Instruct PCBILLING to report on outstanding bills or summarize
    receipts, receivables, or bad debts.
    
    PCBILLING is menu-driven for ease of use and comes with a set of
    demonstration files to assist you in getting started.
