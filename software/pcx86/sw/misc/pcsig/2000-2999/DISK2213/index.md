## Information about "REFERENCE MGMNT SYS-RSX #1 (2214 ALSO)"

    Reference Management System is a self-explanatory, menu-driven system
    for handling bibliographic references:  data entry, viewing, searching,
    tabulation, and reporting.  It provides data and index file
    compatibility with dBase III and III+, and it is compiled to provide
    operational speed.  It is organized in five basic menus covering related
    operations.  Searches include scanning, single and multi-item, and
    output can be sent to printer or disk in linear or card formats, with
    user control of included fields.
