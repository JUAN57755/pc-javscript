## Information about "TAPCIS"

    TAPCIS automates the use of CompuServe and, in the process, reduces
    connect time to a minimum.  The time-consuming tasks of reading or
    replying are done using the facilities of your own computer where the
    computer time is "free."
    
    This efficiency can save you a great deal of money.  If it takes ten
    minutes to compose a message online, it could cost you two dollars or
    more.  Prepared offline and sent with TAPCIS, the cost might be as low
    as 22 cents for the same message.  TAPCIS makes it possible for you to
    actively participate in the forum without destroying your budget.
