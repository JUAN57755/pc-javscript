## Information about "DSKRAK"

    Quickly organizes your software into a professional library with fast
    access to information about specific files or programs.
    
    DSKrak manages your software by dividing your programs into "trays" of
    diskettes in the same way that you would use a tray to store disks.
    Each disk in a particular tray can be assigned a number from 0-999.
    Each record, which you can browse or print, contains a wide variety of
    important information that you can use to find your software. As well
    as tray and disk number, add title, comments, user-definable
    categories, and the total number of bytes available on a particular
    disk.
    
    Create a comprehensive printed index listing for use outside the
    program. Sort by number, category, or file name. When you're looking
    for that specific program, or want to see exactly what game or utility
    programs you've got, you'll have complete information at your
    fingertips.
