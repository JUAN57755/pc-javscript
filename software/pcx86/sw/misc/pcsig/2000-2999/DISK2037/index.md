## Information about "L-A-S-E-R LETTERHEAD PLUS"

    This program is an easy-to-use laser printing program that will let you
    create letterhead stationery and matching envelopes on your HP LaserJet
    printer.  This includes all Hewlett Packard printers except the original
    LaserJet Model.  Supported models are the LaserJet Plus, LaserJet 500
    Plus, LaserJet 200, Series II, Series IID, Series IIP, and the new
    Series III. A closely compatible laser printer may also be used.
    
    All font handling is automatically done for you.  Copy your fonts into
    the directory with the program files, place the font names in the Setup
    program, and you are ready to go.  With a few menu choices you can
    create stationery that looks as though it came from a typesetter's
    workbench.
    
    Any laser printer using Level IV (page formatting feature) HP Printer
    Command Language (PCL) can use LASER LETTERHEAD.  Using proportional
    fonts of your choice you may select centered or left justified groupings
    with ten variations of borders and shadings precisely formatted and
    calculated.  You do not need bold type: the program will make bold type
    from your light or regular fonts.
    
    Create not only a business letterhead, but a personal version also. You
    do not have to calculate each line of print, nor worry about the
    difficult task of centering proportional fonts.  The program does it all
    for you.  Boxing in lines is a snap, and shading the letterhead is a
    matter of choice.  Everything is menu-driven to make it easy.
    
    Addresses placed on envelopes can be saved to the address database and
    used again.  This dBASE-type file can be exported to a wordprocessor
    and used to write form letters.
