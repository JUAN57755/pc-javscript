## Information about "SWAPDOS"

    With SWAPDOS, one DOS application may run another, even if both would
    normally not fit in memory at the same time.  By copying base memory,
    used by the currently running application, to expanded memory/extended
    memory, or to a disk file, base memory needed by the application is
    freed up.  The desired program is run before restoring the original
    environment.
    
    Swap out single programs, multiple programs, resident programs, etc.
    The amount of extra memory gained by using SWAPDOS depends on the
    application(s) being swapped out.  In general, all of the memory used
    by your program is available for use, minus about 3000 bytes.
    
    If you use one or two main programs and wish to switch among them, or
    to switch to other programs, SWAPDOS is essential.  If you only have
    640K with no expanded or extended memory, it's indispensable!
