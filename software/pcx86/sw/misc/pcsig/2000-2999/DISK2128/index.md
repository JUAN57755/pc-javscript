## Information about "MEAL MASTER"

    One of the toughest parts of being in charge of family meals is
    deciding, week after week, what you're going to cook.  Another tough
    part is trying to remember to put all the important ingredients
    down on one shopping list so you can actually cook the meals.
    If you're rich, you avoid the whole problem and get a housekeeper. If
    you're smart, you get MEAL MASTER.
    
    MEAL MASTER is the program that home users dreamt about when the
    computer industry said, "... and you can keep recipes in it, too!" Now
    you really can. MEAL MASTER stores up to 500 recipes,
    automatically schedules up to 14 days of meals, and creates and
    prints a shopping list of ingredients in all the meals on your
    schedule.
    
    MEAL MASTER is easy to get along with, too.  You have total control
    over the recipes, schedules and lists.  You can print any or all of
    your recipes and change the number of servings they're written for. You
    can easily edit your shopping list before you print it so it only shows
    the items you need to buy rather than everything you're going to cook.
    
    Even if normal meal planning is a breeze for you, MEAL MASTER can prove
    invaluable for those special occasions when you find yourself catering a
    family reunion or having to plan two weeks worth of meals for a nursery
    school program.  Whatever size family you're feeding, MEAL MASTER can
    make the process almost painless.
