## Information about "PHARAOH'S TOMB"

    On an expedition far within the icy mountains of Norway, you discover a
    crevice that leads you deep into the jagged rock.  You find yourself
    inside a vast underground empire -- an enormous network of caves,
    passages and chambers.  Local legend speaks of a famous mythological
    deity who once ruled these peaks.  Have you stumbled onto his kingdom?
    You decide to find out.... As you explore, you must overcome the many
    creatures that patrol this place.  Use your gun (with unlimited
    bullets) to shoot creatures and creature generators.  Other hazards to
    overcome are: underground streams flowing with currents that can drag
    you away, bubbling lava pits and lakes, and the very dangerous Thor
    Beast, which creates creatures with devastating speed!
    
    CAVES OF THOR is a brilliant 16-color arcade/graphics game with a 4-way
    scrolling playfield.  Explore seven huge levels for the three Symbols of
    Virtue -- needed to finish CAVES OF THOR.  This program features some of
    the best music heard in a shareware game.  Other nice features include a
    save/restore option, friendly keyboard controls, a demonstration mode,
    permanent high score record, and an easy-playing cheat mode!
    
    If you enjoyed the Kroz games, you'll enjoy this one, too.
