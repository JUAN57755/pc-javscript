## Information about "NEWQUIZ/QUIZWHIZ"

    NEWQUIZ lets you make tests, quizzes, and trivia games as fast as you
    can type.  Just type in a question, add the multiple choice answers
    (only one correct answer of course), note the correct answer, and you
    have a quiz.  Make up one question; make up as many as your disk will
    hold -- it's that easy.
    
    Then, using QUIZWIZ, take the quizzes you made and test yourself or
    friends.  QUIZWIZ lets up to four people take the same quiz at the same
    time.  It keeps track of right and wrong answers, and the percentage of
    correct answers.
    
    To get you started, QUIZWIZ comes with an example quiz with 900
    questions about the Bible.  Use it to make your own quizzes or just to
    brush up on your Bible trivia.  Either way NEWQUIZ/QUIZWIZ is a winner.
