## Information about "VBUG"

    VBUG is a visual debug program interface for all users of the debug
    program, providing an improved "screen oriented" interface using
    standard debug commands.  VBUG provides full command line editing
    features, including recall of the last 10 commands for entry or editing.
    On-line help is provided for all commands, and frequently used commands
    (such as trace and proceed) can be entered by pressing a function key.
    VBUG provides "paging" dump and unassemble commands and always shows the
    file currently being debugged.  VBUG also allows saving the file size
    via function key and later resetting the file size, also by a function
    key.
