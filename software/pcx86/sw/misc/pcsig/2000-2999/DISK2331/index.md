## Information about "SR-INFO 2 OF 2 (2330 ALSO)"

    For anyone requiring a database, SR-INFO is capable of almost any
    database task from the most simple flat file application to complex
    relational database applications. SR-INFO is an upgrade of VP-Info,
    version 1.
    
    A relational database working with up to six data files at one time, it
    also works with any DOS file in both sequential and random access
    modes.
    
    A rich set of commands speeds the development of applications of any
    complexity. Programs compile to a special compact format and then run
    with blazing speed. Extensive on-line help and a comprehensive set of
    demonstration programs help new users get "up to speed" quickly.
    
    Speed is a hallmark of SR-INFO. Programs are compiled before
    they are run. The compilation is to a special SR-INFO format that runs
    at the same speed as C code. Comments in program files have no effect
    on execution speed -- a big plus when compared to database languages
    that interpret each line of code as it is read
    
    In addition to .DBF data files, SR-INFO can work with a variety of
    external formats including .SDF files. Any file can be processed one
    byte at a time, sequentially, or in random access mode. ASCII files
    can also be processed one line at a time. Data may be moved to and
    from serial ports.
