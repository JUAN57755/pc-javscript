## Information about "SWAP SHOP & CASHFLOW"

    CASHFLOW is an integrated, menu-driven, practical budgeting tool that
    can simplify home record-keeping by calculating checks and balancing
    the checkbook.
    
    You can hold back checks that you've written until Payday gets here.
    CASHFLOW won't write checks for you but will track and calculate the
    ones that you write.  It will tell you what your bills are averaging
    and what percentage of your money goes for insurance, transportation,
    entertainment, etc.
    
    SWAP SHOP is a collection of various programs used for swapping printer
    and communication port addresses electronically.  No more resetting
    mechanical switches.  Documentation and Assembly source code are
    included.
