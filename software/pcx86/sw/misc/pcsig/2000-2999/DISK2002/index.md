## Information about "QUATTRO & 1-2-3 FOR WORDPERFECT"

    QWP makes life easier for editors and others who frequently
    incorporate spreadsheets into WordPerfect documents.  QWP converts
    Lotus 1-2-3 (Versions 1A and 2.1) and Quattro (Versions 1.0 and 1.1)
    spreadsheet files into WordPerfect 4.2 files (readable by WordPerfect
    Versions 4.2 and above).
    
    QWP allows column alignments to be maintained when the WordPerfect user
    wishes to incorporate a spreadsheet into a document formatted for a
    printer using proportional spacing.  This offers an advantage over the
    commonly used technique of "printing" spreadsheets to an ASCII format
    disk file and importing them into WordPerfect, because the conversion
    process translates all tabs into a fixed number of spaces.  QWP
    automatically calculates an appropriate tab format for each line, even
    as data types change.
    
    Most users who are already familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro and
    WordPerfect will find QWP's documentation adequate to get them
    started.  However, they should be prepared to experiment a bit in order
    to produce exactly the results they want.  This time will be repaid by
    eliminating hours reformatting or retyping a spreadsheet in order to
    align the columns.
    
    The registration provisions are unusually generous, allowing a
    registered user to make an unlimited number of copies for all
    machines located at a single street address.
