## Information about "PERSONAL PORTFOLIO ANALYZER, DISK 1 OF 2"

    THE PERSONAL PORTFOLIO ANALYZER performs record-keeping, analysis and
    reporting on any number of portfolios containing mutual funds, stocks,
    bonds, time deposits and other securities.
    
    This program calculates market values, realized and unrealized gains and
    losses, holding periods, annual percentage returns, expected annual
    income and yield before and after taxes.  Reports, which can be
    displayed on screen or printer, include income and taxability
    analysis, realized (tax) gains and losses, and current market value
    analysis.  In addition, a list of expected income payments can be
    printed for the next 12 months.  Expected income can be broken down
    monthly for budgeting purposes, and by security type and taxability
    (non-taxable, taxable Federal and taxable State) for tax planning.
    Total market value can be broken down by security type, portfolio name
    or industry category.  Up to four portfolios may be combined in all
    reports.
    
    THE PERSONAL PORTFOLIO ANALYZER is designed to be easy to use for
    individuals and small fund managers.  Entry of the market price for one
    security, or application of a stock split or other distribution for one
    security, in any portfolio, automatically applies to that security in
    all portfolios.  Security sales may be applied on a first-in first-out
    or last-in first-out basis, or applied to a particular purchase lot.
    When necessary, a purchase lot is automatically split into two parts.
