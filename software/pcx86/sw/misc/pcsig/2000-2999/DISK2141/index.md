## Information about "CRYPTO! & CRYPTO! MAKER"

    Are you a cryptogram junkie? CRYPTO! and CRYPTO MAKER give you the
    chance to solve and create challenging word puzzles. Test yourself and
    tease your friends with jumbled famous quotes.
    
    Choose from a library containing 200 different puzzles. Ponder over
    the serious and funny quotations provided by the creator, Tom Gough, as
    you rack your brain trying to discover the next letter in the
    quote. Don't cheat! The program will give you hints, but try to
    unearth the answers for yourself. If you are stumped you can "cheat" by
    revealing a letter or use the hint key to tell you whether the letter is
    a vowel or consonant. The name of the speaker of the quotation appears
    when the puzzle is solved.
    
    You can also create your own cryptograms to perplex your friends. Type
    in your favorite quote, change the letter sequence, and you're ready to
    play. Becoming familiar with playing CRYPTO! will help you in making
    your puzzles.
    
    Function keys toggle colors and all puzzles can be printed. Easy-to-use
    instructions and menus give fast access to the game. A great game for
    all adults who enjoy word puzzles.
