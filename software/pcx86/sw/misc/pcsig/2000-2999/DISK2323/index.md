## Information about "ZPAY 3 DISK 2 OF 2"

    Eliminate professional accountants while having complete control over
    your own payroll with ZPAY 3. Handle different pay periods; salaried,
    hourly, commissioned and salary with commission employees; tipped
    employees; non-employees; two overtime rates; bonuses; cost
    accounting; payroll computations; print your own checks and tax
    reports; automatic posting of pay periods!
    
    ZPAY 3 keeps track of multiple companies -- as many as your disk will
    hold!
    
    Eliminate costly programming updates with a built-in tax table editor
    for changing your own tax tables when necessary. A sample payroll
    allows you the opportunity to experiment without using your own
    payroll files!
    
    ZPAY 3 is user-friendly, utilizing clear and simple menus with
    on-screen help windows (at the touch of a key). The pull-down menus and
    pick lists are complete with mouse support!
