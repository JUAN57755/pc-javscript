## Information about "READABILITY PLUS"

    READABILITY PLUS is the ideal complement to any grammar checker, such
    as Grammatik or RightWriter.
    
    Unlike grammar checkers, this program assumes that what it's been asked
    to analyze is mechanically correct.  Rather than look for
    errors, it looks for sentences and words that aren't used
    appropriately for the writer's intended audience.  Comparing the text
    to any of nine writing style models, READABILITY PLUS guides the
    writer in ``aligning'' the style of the draft with the style model
    chosen.  For example, by using the magazine style model for company
    reports, writers can produce more interesting and easier-to-understand
    documents.  READABILITY PLUS can read documents produced with
    WordPerfect, WordStar, Microsoft Word, and all ASCII (text) files.
