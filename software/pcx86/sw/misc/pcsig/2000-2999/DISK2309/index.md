## Information about "FRACTKAL"

    FRACTKAL combines the best of a fractal generator and a kaleidoscope.
    Similar to a kaleidoscope in that it can generate fractals at random,
    this menu-driven program is great for the novice.
    
    Finished fractals, generated by you or by FRACTKAL, can be saved as
    PICT files and may brought up from disk at any time within the
    program.  The documentation is excellent and a short step-by-step
    tutorial is offered.
    
    While a higher-level user might find FRACTKAL's functions limiting, the
    beginner can spend hours experimenting with custom-designing
    fractals or seeing what the computer can come up with.  All this,
    without having to deal with the mind-boggling bells and whistles of the
    more advanced fractal-generating programs.
