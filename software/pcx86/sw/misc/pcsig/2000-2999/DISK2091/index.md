## Information about "PC-WRITE LITE 2 OF 2 (ALSO #2090)"

    Here's a simpler version of Quicksoft's popular PC-Write
    wordprocessor.  By removing some of the complexities of PC-Write,
    Quicksoft has tailored LITE to the needs of a different class of user.
    Since document files and most keyboard commands are the same in both
    LITE and full PC-Write, it's easy to move from one program to the
    other.
    
    LITE is designed for laptop users, programmers, creative writers,
    students, and anyone else who may not need full PC-Write's advanced
    formatting features.
    
    Some of the features that PC-WRITE LITE supports are:
    
    ~ The same editing keys as PC-WRITE
    
    ~ Block and box operations
    
    ~ Search and replace
    
    ~ Common ruler margins and controls
    
    ~ Standard spell-checking
    
    ~ Basic page layout commands
    
    ~ Footnotes and auto-numbering
    
    ~ Common typefaces and effects
    
    ~ New, simplified printing
    
    Some of the features that PC-WRITE LITE doesn't support:
    
    ~ Absolute measurements
    
    ~ Ruler letters and dot commands
    
    ~ Mail merge
    
    PC-WRITE LITE can be used to create simple letters, memos, and
    articles, or to edit copy for later desktop publishing in an easy and
    efficient way.  Since the program only needs 256K (without the
    speller) it's an ideal editor for laptops.  This program is sure to
    become a favorite among people needing a quick and easy wordprocessor.
