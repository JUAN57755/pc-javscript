## Information about "NG_MAKER PROGRAMMER'S TOOL"

    This program is designed to be used in conjunction with the Norton
    Guides, by Peter Norton Computing, and PC-Browse, by QuickSoft. It reads
    the ASCII source code for any program and extracts the comments which
    indicate the purpose, function, and expectations of the various building
    blocks of your program.
    
    NG_MAKER will combine and assemble these comments into a database file
    compatible with the Norton Guides or PC-Browse.  Once completed, you can
    call up either program and review at a glance the various building
    blocks that make up the program you are working on.
    
    The program is designed to work in cooperation with MicroSoft-
    compatible MAKE files that control the compilation of large projects.
    Using NG_MAKER will require that you make small changes in your MAKE
    file and to the source code for your project.  In each case, the changes
    are all "hidden" behind remark symbols, so they are completely invisible
    to your compiler/assembler.
