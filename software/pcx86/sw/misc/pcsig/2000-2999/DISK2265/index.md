## Information about "SIMPLE PROJECT"

    Here 's a project management program that features Gantt charts,
    outline mode, risk analysis, pro-forma financial statements, ROI/ATO
    analysis and cash flow analysis.
    
    This is not a fancy-looking program -- there are no flashy screens or
    displays -- but it's a very workable one.  The program is run by
    command lines throughout its various different screens, each with a
    prompt line that explains the purpose of the highlighted item.
    
    SIMPLE PROJECT could prove to be an invaluable tool for a project
    manager or a student of the field.
