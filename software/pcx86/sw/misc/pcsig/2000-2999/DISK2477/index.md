## Information about "CLUB-EZ"

    CLUB-EZ is a simple to use program designed to handle any club or
    organization's record keeping, including membership, attendance and
    financial information. The program is powerful enough for the
    experienced PC user yet, because it is "menu" driven, allows people who
    probably have not had much experience with a PC or software packages to
    be up and running in minutes.
    
    CLUB-EZ is in full color, with no graphic cards or printer drivers
    needed, and is packed with features. It prints 2 kinds of club rosters,
    and will print dues statements on plain paper or letterhead for ANY
    billing cycle. It produces mailing labels for members, guests, and dues
    statements, tracks attendance, and easily handles meeting reservations.
    The financial module (which is sent free with your $45 registration)
    allows you to set up a budget and track income and expenses for any
    period. The module also allows you to set up your own income and expense
    categories.
    
    CLUB-EZ seems to be particularly advantageous in that years of club
    records can be saved for future reference and because it eliminates
    compatibility problems when transferring records from one year (or
    person) to the next, making CLUB-EZ a good value and useful for years to
    come.
