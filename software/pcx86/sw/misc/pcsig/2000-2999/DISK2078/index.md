## Information about "FANTASY SPORTS DRAFTER"

    What is more fun than collecting and trading baseball cards;
    permits you to rub elbows with owners, starters and free agents;
    provides you the opportunity to compete against other players; and,
    doesn't stick to most dental work? It's Fantasy Leagues!
    
    FANTASY LEAGUES are springing up across the country, covering baseball,
    football, basketball -- all major league sports.  Developing your
    fantasy team from the real players in the major leagues, you earn points
    depending on how a real player performs during a season.  But how do you
    put your team together?
    
    FANTASY SPORT DRAFTER provides you with a computerized opponent in the
    team draft arena.  You can go up against it as many times as you wish,
    learning the ins and outs of actual fantasy drafting.  When you're
    finished, you'll have assembled your own team from the best of the
    major leagues in that sport.  You'll hardly be able to wait for the
    start of the season.
    
    After you have developed your team, FANTASY SPORT DRAFTER allows you
    to submit your picks to a fantasy sports center to compete in an actual
    drafting contest.  Your team may win the title of Fantasy Team Champion.
