## Information about "APORIA"

    APORIA brings even more of a Macintosh operating system to Windows,
    complete with trash can.  At its most powerful, APORIA replaces Windows'
    Program Manager with a tool-laden shell.  APORIA places file drawers
    onscreen; click on a drawer, and it shows you the contents (as icons).
    Click again, and the drawer closes, taking the icons with it.  You can
    set up your own drawers and files.  You can even get help by dragging an
    application over to the question mark icon.
