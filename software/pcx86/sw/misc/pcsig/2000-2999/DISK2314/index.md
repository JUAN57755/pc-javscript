## Information about "LE_C C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS"

    The LE_C LIBRARY is a set of C run-time functions that allow you to
    easily create programs that implement many of today's standard user
    interfaces such as menus, box menus, data entry, help facility, line
    drawing, border drawing (including exploding boxes), and more.
    
    What makes the LE_C LIBRARY unique is its integrated help facility. All
    of the menu and input functions support help screens.  Specify help
    screens unique to each menu selection and even move the help window
    within the screen.  Help screens are an important part of any program,
    especially those using data-entry.  The LE_C LIBRARY provides you with
    the help functions you need to build professional-looking programs.
    
    Specify up to 40 special function keys (Ctrl-F1, Ctrl-End, etc.) for
    use with the menu and input functions.  These 40 keys are in addition
    to the pre-defined commonly-used function keys.  The screen functions
    write directly to video memory resulting in exceptional display speed.
    
    You can increase the functional and aesthetic value of your programs
    with the LE_C C LIBRARY functions.  A demonstration program is included
    to illustrate the value of this library.
