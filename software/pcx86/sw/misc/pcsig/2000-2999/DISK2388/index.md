## Information about "ADVANCED CHURCH INFORMATION SYSTEMS:ACIS"

    ACIS (Advanced Church Information Systems) is a friendly system
    designed to increase church productivity by keeping relevant
    information about members, visitors, and organizations.  This
    information can then be used to print mailing labels, Rolodex cards,
    and a variety of reports.
    
    Menu-driven ACIS requires no prior experience with database programs in
    order to be productive right away.
    
    ACIS was programmed by John M. Phillips for the First United Methodist
    Church of Allen, Texas, but has been adapted for use with most
    denominations.  ACIS is divided into four distinct systems:  the member
    information system, capable of storing 800 records; the visitor
    information system, also 800 records; the organization information
    system, 500 records; and the utility functions.  The variety of reports
    the systems generate, together with an informative manual and easy
    program, fit in well with a church that wants to be the ``home''
    church of its congregation.
