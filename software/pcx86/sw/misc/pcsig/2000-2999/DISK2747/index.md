Prism is a shareware utility that will allow you to reset the color

use with ANY non-graphics program.

PRISM contains nearly 60K of help screens.  Enter the PRISM editor
and press <F1><F1> to get to the Help Index.  PRISM's help screens
will teach everything you need to know to use the program effectively.
You will be creating bright new colors for your VGA system within minutes.

PRISM110.EXE is a self-extracting archive.  It contains the following files

  README       -- this file.
  PRISM   .EXE -- the amazing VGA palette editor.
  P       .BAT -- a batch file for using PRISM from any subdirectory.
  PDEMO   .EXE -- a self-running demonstration which will display all
                  palette files in the same subdirectory.
  *       .PAL -- a variety of palette files demonstrating some of
                  the palettes you can create with PRISM.

PRISM was written in Turbo Pascal 6.0, from Borland International.
PRISM also makes use of the Object Professional library from TurboPower.
