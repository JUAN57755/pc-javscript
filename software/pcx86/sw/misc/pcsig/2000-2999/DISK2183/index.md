## Information about "HOME TAX OFFICE 1989"

    LONG DESCRIPTION
    If you have a home office, you'll find HOME OFFICE TAX 1989 especially
    useful.  Using simple data entry sheets, you can determine amount of
    your Home Office tax deduction.  Once computed, it can be attached to
    your SCHEDULE 2106 [EMPLOYEE EXPENSE SHEET], or the amount can be
    entered on your SCHEDULE C [SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON] tax form.
    
    The data forms ask for such information as:  Do you own your home or
    rent?  If owned, you'll enter mortgage information, interest, property
    taxes paid, and other information.  If rented, you'll enter the
    monthly payments.  In addition, you'll enter the utilities and other
    maintenance costs.  You'll also enter the total square footage of the
    home and the amount of office square footage being used.
    
    The beauty of the program is it will generate reports in far less time
    than it takes you to gather the data for it.
    
    HOME OFFICE TAX 1989 is simple, functional, and beneficial to those
    looking for a program that determines the tax benefit of having and
    maintaining an office in the home.
    
    This is not a tax preparation program.  It produces only this one set
    of reports.
