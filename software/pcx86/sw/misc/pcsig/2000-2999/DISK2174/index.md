## Information about "SOCIAL SECURITY CALCULATOR"

    Will you receive the maximum Social Security retirement benefits?  If
    you're uncertain, SOCIAL SECURITY CALCULATOR will tell you. It will
    estimate what your monthly retirement payment check will be for you and
    your dependent(s) for both retirement at age 65 and for optional
    retirement at earlier or later ages of your choice. It will also show
    the reduction in your monthly payment if you have continued earned
    income and/or if you have a pension based upon wages which were not
    subject to Social Security deductions.
    
    Although there is no manual, the program is easy to follow. Data is
    included for those born between 1917 and 1949.
