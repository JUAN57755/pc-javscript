## Information about "SBAS GENERAL LEDGER"

    Finally, an easy double entry bookkeeping system designed around a
    general ledger! SBAS (Small Business Accounting System) lets a small
    company track income and expenses and print reports on demand.
    
    SBAS doesn't have modules for receivables, payables, and payroll, but
    instead uses the general ledger system to perform these tasks.
    Consequently you can't print invoices, but it does keep everything
    simpler.
    
    Its on-line help screen is very helpful. And it automatically checks
    for valid account numbers during entry and allows new accounts to be
    added during entry.
    
    Installing the program isn't difficult. The manual and program
    provide the information to set up your books in a short period of time.
    Easy-to-read reports can be produced as needed. The system uses a five-
    digit account numbering system, and the manual suggests a certain way of
    setting up the accounts, but you can change it if you want.
    Overall, this is a good accounting package for businesses that
    don't need all the modules.
