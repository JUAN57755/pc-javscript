## Information about "WACKY1"

    Just when you thought all the clip art you ever needed could be found in
    the 18-disk Cooper Graphics set, Cooper Graphics comes out with still
    another fun set of art, this time as WACKY1.
    
    This graphics series introduces 2-inch tall by 7-inch wide
    graphic headers intended to top memos and notepads.  All five pictures
    follow the theme of health and hair with pictures of men shaving, a man
    sneezing, the stork with a baby, a bedridden parrot, and a Bald is
    Beautiful Banner.
    
    WACKY1's graphics can be printed on laserjets, deskjets, and other
    printers that suppport the .PCX and .MAC formats.
