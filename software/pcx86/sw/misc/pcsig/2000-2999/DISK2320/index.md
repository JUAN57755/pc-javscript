## Information about "ORGANIZE!"

    ORGANIZE! -- an innovative, cost-effective PIM (Personal Information
    Manager) for Windows.
    
    No matter how disorganized you are, this program can track all of your
    important projects without the complex and rigid control systems most
    PIMs use.  Cluttered with unused functions, they steepen the learning
    curve unnecessarily.  With ORGANIZE!, add new functions only as you
    need them.  Learn as you go.
    
    One of the easiest-to-use systems ever, ORGANIZE! looks and feels just
    like a diary.  Flip pages like the real thing with binders that click
    open to insert more pages. The Word-in-Context system will manage all
    random AND structured personal information that you enter into the
    diary.  You will never lose your way in this piece of software.
    
    If you are looking for a program to help you record contacts, schedule
    appointments, track projects, or control random notes and ideas, this
    may be for you.
