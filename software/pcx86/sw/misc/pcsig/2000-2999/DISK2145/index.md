## Information about "HANDICAP HORSE RACING"

    Here's a horse racing simulation so real it practically leaves
    hoofprints.  You control the horse registry, jockey, feed bills, stall
    rentals, liqudations, claiming races, auctions, and pari-mutuel
    betting.  HANDICAP HORSE RACING has brought what used to be a simple
    game into the world of high stakes and heart-pounding finishes.
    
    You're the marshal, or track commissioner, and you have a lot to do
    before, during and after the race.  Before you even open the gates to
    the track, you must prepare the registry, see to your funds for race
    pay-offs, and rental and fees from your track stables.  When your
    guests arrive, they'll be bringing their own money (play) for a day at
    the races.  The system will make the race call and help you determine
    the payoff after a race.
    
    With your registry changing as a result of each race, the excitment
    will grow every time you play.  Your guests will look forward to
    playing their "Best of Breed" against the field.  A limited number of
    horses running on an oval track with no betting action are supported.
    Registered users receive a track construction system, full betting
    action and a large stable of horses.
