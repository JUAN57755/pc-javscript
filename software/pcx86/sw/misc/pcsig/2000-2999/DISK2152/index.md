## Information about "FILEBASE"

    If your data needs constantly drag you between your database and mail
    list output, FILEBASE is the database for you. This powerful system
    keeps data in mail list format. You'll never have to generate mail
    list output again -- it's already there!
    
    For technicians, FILEBASE is a variable-length fields data manager,
    storing records in ASCII comma delimited format. This is the type of
    file created by many versions of the BASIC language, sometimes referred
    to as "MailMerge" format.
    
    The files used by FILEBASE to maintain your database records can be
    used directly by the letter-merge functions of most word processors
    including: WordStar/Mailmerge, DisplayWrite, Multimate, Word, XyWrite,
    PC-Write, and others.
    
    FILEBASE's strong database capabilities work with any MailMerge file. --
    even if it was created with some other program. Sort, merge,
    split, and modify. Apply functions like restructuring, indexing,
    appending new records, adding new fields, joining them, performing
    calculations, and generating reports and labels. Comma delimited
    format records can be converted to block format and vice versa.
    
    Special sort features and full search capability is also supported.
    Look for a record by number or use logical tests to find numbers. Wild
    card searches are supported.
