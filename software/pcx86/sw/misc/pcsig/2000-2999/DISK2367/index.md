## Information about "RECURSIVE REALM"

    Experience the fascinating beauty of fractals.  Use RECURSIVE REALM to
    build and explore Mandelbrot sets, Julia sets (5 equations), Newton's
    method (13 equations), and models of magnetism from a detailed menu
    system.
    
    RECURSIVE REALM uses expanded memory where available.  Files are saved
    in .PCX format for use with many commercial and shareware packages. It
    features zooming, escape sequence tracking, easy coloring, slide show
    animation and more.  Save designs at any stage of development and
    resume building at a later time.  The program contains some sample
    pictures to get you started and help is available anytime.
