## Information about "STAINED GLASS"

    Danger danger danger -- imprudent use of STAINED GLASS may get you
    fired!  Just ask the programmer's sister-in-law, who brought work to a
    standstill at a large New York investment banking firm after loading
    STAINED GLASS onto the company network server....
    
    Simple to learn, yet devilishly difficult to master, STAINED GLASS is
    almost pathologically addictive.  Remember the game you played with golf
    tees and a block of wood, jumping one tee over another into an empty
    hole and removing the tee you jumped, until there was only one tee left?
    STAINED GLASS takes that basic idea, substitutes colored panes of glass
    for golf tees, and adds primary and secondary colors and a very simple
    set of rules that you learned in kindergarten -- blue plus yellow makes
    green, orange minus red leaves yellow, and so on.
    
    STAINED GLASS has all of the bells and whistles you would expect with a
    top-of-the-line strategy game, including such options as load, save,
    undo, hint, restart, and a panic button, just in case the boss walks by!
    
    Furthermore, the author is trying a very interesting experiment with the
    shareware registration system.  He calls it "commissionware" -- if you
    send him your $25 registration fee, he will send you your own serialized
    copy of STAINED GLASS.  If you make copies and give them to your friends
    and one of them sends in his or her registration fee, you will receive
    a $5.00 commission.
