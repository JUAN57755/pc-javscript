## Information about "PTE, THE PROGRAMMER'S TEXT EDITOR"

    PTE is a fast full-screen programmer's editor with Wordstar-like
    commands, a complete command menu, multiple windows (limited only by
    memory), and an ``intelligent file finder.'' The editor includes all of
    the usual block commands, including copy to printer or file, block
    import and export, insert & delete, undo, autoindent, wordwrap, etc.
    
    PTE may be entered from the command line or the menu. You don't even
    have to have the correct spelling of the file to be edited!  PTE
    maintains a ``directory'' of each drive that it uses for fuzzy
    searching for filenames.
    
    File size is limited only by memory, as are the number of auxiliary
    edit or import windows opened.  PTE is intended for programmers,
    developers, and desktop publishers or anyone else looking to create
    ASCII files. It is suitable for all levels of users.
