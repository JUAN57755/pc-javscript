## Information about "STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL"

    Being an armchair baseball manager is a tough job.  For all the work you
    do during the season, the players on the screen never do what you tell
    them to do.  You yell "run for third base" and they stay put at second,
    or you tell them to bunt and they strike out.  Now there's hope.
    
    STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL lets you bring together two major league
    baseball teams, historical as well as current, and let them do battle on
    the diamond, with you as their manager.  You can pit your managerial
    skills against the computer, a fellow armchair manager, or let two
    computerized managers go at it head to head.
    
    STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL provides you with players from The 1988
    Cubs, A's, Bluejays and Giants, as well as The 1950 Red Sox and The 1936
    Yankees (over 120 more teams are available from the author). It's the
    answer to the question of what to do after the World Series.  Play ball!
