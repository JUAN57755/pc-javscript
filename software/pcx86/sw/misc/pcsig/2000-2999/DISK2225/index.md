## Information about "WORD GALLERY"

    This educational program helps children to associate the printed word
    with the object it describes.  Word Gallery is a set of colorful
    word-object flashcards.  Children 4-7, will enjoy watching the screen
    fill with color as they match the words with their pictures.
    
    The program has four separate ``games'' or ``levels''.
    
    When a child first gets started, he selects a picture, the computer
    colors it, and its word will be displayed.
    
    After becoming familiar with the word that describes the picture, the
    child can advance to the next game.  Here, the computer displays a word
    at the top of the screen.  When the child selects the picture described
    by the word, the picture is colored.
    
    The third game reinforces what has been learned in the first two
    levels.  A picture is displayed and when the child selects the word
    which describes the picture, the picture is colored.
    
    The last level is the real test.  One of the pictures is highlighted
    and puts the word which describes the picture at the top of the
    screen.  The word, however, is missing one of the letters.  When the
    child types the missing letter on the keyboard, the picture is colored
    and the complete word displayed.
    
    In all levels, when correct answers are given and the screen has been
    colored, a song will play.  This is a fun program for kids with lots of
    rewards and lots of learning!
