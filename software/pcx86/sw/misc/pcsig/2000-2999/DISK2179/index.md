## Information about "SALES COMMISSION TRACKER"

    Quit wondering how your sales people are doing in the field and what you
    owe them in commission.  SCT lets a company or organization
    track commissions due the sales staff in an orderly manner.
    
    SCT is easy to use and set up.  It assumes you're familiar with its
    terms and doesn't define them.
    
    The function keys shouldn't be used.  If they are, strange things pop up
    that need to be erased.  Those familiar with dBASE, dBXL, or
    FoxBase instantly recognize the keys are defined for database work. SCT
    does not use them and neither should you.
    
    When the manual is expanded to define program terms and when the
    program is revised to accept rates with at least two decimal points,
    this will be a good program to use.
