## Information about "FIND DUPLICATES/COPYCON/GBLINK"

    FIND DUPLICATES will search a specified hard drive and all
    subdirectories and locate all duplicate files. Once the duplicate files
    are located they are displayed on the screen. Files can be tagged for
    deletion, viewed, printed or deleted. This program is very easy to use
    and the documentation is excellent.
    
    COPYCON is a program designed to take the place of the DOS command "COPY
    CON" commonly used to create BATCH files.  The program allows
    full screen editing of your file with line length of up to 80
    characters.  COPYCON also provides a number of "macro" keys to help make
    the process simpler.  These macros include some of the common commands
    used in batch files (ie. echo, rem, etc.), as well as macro keys for all
    of the single and double-line graphics characters.  This makes simple
    work of adding graphics boxes to your batch files.  There are no block
    commands included, as this is not designed to be a full featured text
    editor, however there is a command to copy one line to another.  The
    program is very easy to use and the documentation, although not really
    needed, is quite complete.
    
    gBLINK is a simple utility to blank your pc's screen after a specified
    period of inactivity on the keyboard.  The program also includes an
    onscreen clock which can be turned on and off from the keyboard (the
    clock is positioned in the upper right corner of the screen).  The
    program is extremely simple to install and uninstall,  and comes
    complete with documentation to help you get started.
