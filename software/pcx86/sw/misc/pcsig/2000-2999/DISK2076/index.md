## Information about "CREATIVITY PACKAGE 2 OF 3 (2075, 2077)"

    The CREATIVITY PACKAGE is a three disk creativity and idea generator.
    Disk one contains Thomas A. Easton's complete book, "Think Thunder! And
    Unleash Your Creativity," a straightforward explanation of the nature of
    creativity and how to develop it.  Disk two contains the program,
    THUNDER THOUGHT, a proven tool for computer-aided brainstorming,
    developing and refining ideas, particularly in the fields of creative
    writing and inventing.  Disk three contains VERSIFIER, the amazing
    poetry writing program that works with the user's word selection to
    create fascinating free verse or haiku poetry.  Considering that any one
    of these disks could be tremendously helpful in understanding and
    developing creative thinking, the effect of all three may be mind
    expanding!
    "Think Thunder!" can be read chapter by chapter on the computer screen
    or printed out.  The book can encourage creative thinking with or
    without the use of THUNDER THOUGHT.
    
    THUNDER THOUGHT works to facilitate the creative process by automating
    its initial stages.  With it, you don't need to worry about how to come
    up with novel combinations of words, images, or ideas.  THUNDER THOUGHT
    will do that for you, leaving you with the task of finding or
    recognizing sense in whatever combinations of words and ideas it
    produces.  THUNDER THOUGHT offers a variety of approaches for this
    creative process including images, topical idea chaining, and other
    innovative ways to expand your idea bank.
    
    VERSIFIER is a creativity-enhancement program for poets. The program
    combines words and phrases into several kinds of free verse and haiku,
    which you can then save and edit.  To get started, both THUNDER THOUGHT
    and VERSIFIER come with a vocabulary.  These lists can be modified or
    replaced to include your own words and thoughts.  The program puts ideas
    together in ways you might not have thought of consciously, yet they are
    still your own ideas, expressed in your own words.
