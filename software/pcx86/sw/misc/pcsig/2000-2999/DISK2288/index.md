## Information about "TECHSTAFF TOOLS #1 (2289 ALSO)"

    This program is designed to be used in conjunction with the NORTON
    GUIDES, PC-BROWSE, and MicroSoft-compatible MAKE files that control the
    compilation of large projects. It reads the ASCII source code for any
    program and extract the comments which indicate the purpose, function,
    and expectations of the various building blocks of your program.
    
    NG_MAKER will combine and assemble these comments in a database file
    compatible with the NORTON GUIDES or PC-BROWSE. Once completed, you
    can call up either program and review the various building blocks of
    the program you are working on.
