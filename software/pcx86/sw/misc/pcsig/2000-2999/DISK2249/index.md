## Information about "FX - FILE EXAMINER"

    This program can be used by the novice to view any file, or by more
    experienced users to decipher, analyze, and understand file formats.
    
    FX is a "byte-level" word processor. Scroll through any DOS file,
    (even damaged files). Request that the display be formatted in any of
    seven ways (any mix of ASCII, hexadecimal or decimal).
    
    An important, and unique, feature is the "Numeric Display" that
    appears at the top center of the screen. Many database and word
    processing files contain integers and long integers in the file to
    indicate the number of records, offsets of certain information in the
    file, etc. FX continuously displays this information (the values of
    the byte, integer and long integer) in decimal, hexadecimal or binary,
    in both signed and unsigned forms. Without this feature, it can be
    tiresome to calculate this by hand, since the bytes are physically
    stored in reverse order.
    
    Any possible series of file bytes can be located, counted or modified
    using FX, including ASCII 0.
    
    FX has the built-in ability to automatically optimize its formatting
    parameters for dBASE database files, creating a binary "browse" for
    both the header AND data areas.
