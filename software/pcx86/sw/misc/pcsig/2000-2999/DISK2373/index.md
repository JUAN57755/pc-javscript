## Information about "DBCLEAN"

    DBCLEAN is designed to search for, and optionally delete, duplicate
    records in a dBase or compatible file. Finding and eliminating
    duplicate .DBF records can save disk space and program processing time.
    
    DBCLEAN is completely menu-driven, using popular pull-down menus and
    on-line context-sensitive Help screens. A Help screen relating to the
    current operation is always available with a single keystroke,
    eliminating the need to refer to printed documentation.
    
    DBCLEAN provides three modes of operation. In TURBO mode, the easiest
    to use, the selected file is searched based on every field in the
    database. Duplicate records are automatically deleted. In BATCH mode,
    select the fields you want to search on. If any duplicate records are
    found, a list is presented and you select the ones you want deleted.
    INTERACTIVE mode functions the same as BATCH mode except that
    duplicate records are presented to you as they are found and you must
    take action at that time.
