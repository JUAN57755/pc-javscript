## Information about "DBSCAN"

    DBSCAN is an easy-to-use browsing utility that lets you view the
    contents of dBase III files without having to enter the dBase program.
    If the information you need is simple, why are you waiting for dBase to
    load?
    
    This is a stand-alone program accessed from DOS -- you don't even need
    dBase, only dBase-type files. You can view the .DBF files but you
    can't change them. You do, however, have control of the fields
    displayed and their position on the screen.
