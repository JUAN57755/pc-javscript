'=========================================================================

'                   PULLDOWN demonstration program
'                         Using EZWINDOWS library.

'                   Written by
'                         John C. Strong
'                         3155 S.W. 178th Aveneu
'                         Aloha, OR 97006

'=========================================================================

'    Here's how to run this demo in the QB 4.x environment:

'         Make sure the EZPD.QLB file is in the current path,
'         and start QuickBasic using the syntax

'                             QB /L EZPD

'         which loads the quick library EZPD.QLB along with QB.
'         Then load DEMO.BAS from within QB and there you go!

'    Here's how to compile this demo into an executable file:

'         To compile this program (or any other program you may
'         write with EZWINDOW), return to the DOS command line
'         and follow this sequence of commands:

'              BC ProgramName,,nul
'              link /e ProgramName,,,EZPD.LIB

'         Note the difference between EZPD.LIB and EZPD.QLB!
'         Quick libraries are for use only inside the QB environment.
