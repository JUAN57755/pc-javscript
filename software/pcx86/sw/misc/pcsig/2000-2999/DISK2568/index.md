Once again the here is a superb game for all of you who like get away   
from it all and go adventuring to the DARK AGE.                         
                                                                        
Dark Ages is the first shareware game to support the Ad Lib and Sound   
Blaster music cards.  It features a movie-style soundtrack of eight     
unique songs and themes.  It also has sound effects that don't require  
an Ad Lib (or Sound Blaster) card to enjoy.                             
                                                                        
The EGA/VGA graphics are colorful and stunning, with fast scrolling     
screens and high-speed animation.  Dark Ages has such demanding         
graphics and animation that it requires an 80286 (or 80386) machine to  
run at proper speed, otherwise it may run too slowly.  Therefore, Dark  
Ages may only run on the newer, faster PCs and compatibles.             
                                                                        
"Prince of Destiny" is volume one of the Dark Ages trilogy.  Only part  
one is available via shareware distribution, the other two volumes ("The
Undead Kingdom" and "Dungeons of Doom") may only be purchased directly  
from Apogee Software Productions (ASP).  Each volume has its own unique 
appearance, with different goals, level designs and locations.  Each    
volume has 10 huge scrolling levels packed with devious traps, creatures
and treasures.                                                          
                                                                        
Other features include built in instructions, save and restore,         
permanent high scores, sound on/off, flexible keyboard configuration,   
and three skill levels.  Registered players will also receive a secret  
password, which can be used to activate a "child level" mode, and also  
an auto-fire mode, so you can hold down the fire key for continuous     
shots!
