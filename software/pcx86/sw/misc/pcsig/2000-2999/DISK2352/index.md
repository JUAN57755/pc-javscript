## Information about "PEDIT"

    PEDIT is a split-screen text editor that can edit up to four files at a
    single time.  This is a text editor, not a word processor or desktop
    publisher and does not have features such as graphics or multiple
    fonts.  It does, however, have options that programmers need; multiple
    buffers, split-screen editing, access to DOS, insert and overstrike
    modes and auto-indent, to name a few.
    
    While the purpose of PEDIT is to create and edit text, it has some
    features normally associated with word processors such as settable
    margins and autowrapping text, text centering between defined margins,
    words (or parts of words) capitalized, lower-cased, or upper-cased.
    Paragraphs can be filled or reformatted to fit within existing
    margins.
    
    PEDIT also supports definable keys, macros, autosave, recall/edit any
    previous command, DOS buffer, 43-line mode, and colors.  A key feature
    of PEDIT is that the file being edited is stored entirely in memory,
    which makes accessing any part of the file very fast.  Move from the
    top to the bottom of any buffer instantaneously.  The size of the file
    being edited is limited only by the amount of available memory.
    
    If you edit text files, such as computer programs, and want an
    extremely fast split-screen editor, then PEDIT is for you.
