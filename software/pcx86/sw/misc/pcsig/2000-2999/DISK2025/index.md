## Information about "GRADES"

    GRADES is a very simple database designed to track school grades.  It is
    primarily for students who want to keep track of all the courses they
    have taken and pertinent data for each class.  This information includes
    the class name, section name, course number, teacher name, amount of
    credits, test scores, and grade.  Using the test score information you
    can predict the grade, and even see how a grade curve would effect your
    grade.  This makes it very easy to determine one's current standing in a
    class.  Allowing the program to decide the most likely grade, you can
    then see how this grade affects the overall GPA.
