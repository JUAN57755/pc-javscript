## Information about "THE MAGIC FONT MACHINE"

    Want to make some eye catching electronic bulletin board advertisements,
    notes, or screens?  If so, THE MAGIC FONT MACHINE will help you create
    and display brilliantly colored screens with 20 combinations of
    foreground/background colors.  You can have the whole screen in poster
    mode (non flashing) or electric mode (flashing).  The screens you make
    are saved in files and can be used one at a time or all together to make
    a slide show. You can even upload screens to computer bulletin boards
    for advertisements or messages.
    
    We listed the directions below so you could see how easy THE MAGIC FONT
    MACHINE is to use!
    
    ~ Type first line of text.
    
    ~ Text appears instantly in mammoth superfonts.
    
    ~ Select mode and background/foreground colors from the menu.
    
    ~ Position text with Right and Left keys.
    
    ~ Try different color combinations before saving the line.
    
    ~ Select Edit to retype the line if necessary.
    
    ~ Save the line when satisfied, and go on to the next line or screen.
    Thaaaaats all folks!  Be creative and have fun with THE MAGIC FONT
    MACHINE!
