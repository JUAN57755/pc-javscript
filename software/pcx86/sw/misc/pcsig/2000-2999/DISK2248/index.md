## Information about "TREETOP"

    This is a multi-functional hard disk file and directory manager that
    provides an easy-to-use interface to DOS commands. A tree structured
    graphic image of the disk directory structure is first displayed when
    running TREETOP, then a point-and-shoot user interface is used to
    execute commands and navigate through the hard disk. It's fast and
    user-friendly, featuring pull-down menus, on-line context-sensitive
    help, a user-installable setup and full mouse support.
    
    TREETOP helps you organize your files and directories so you can
    easily maintain your hard disk. You can rapidly search, sort, rename,
    add, delete or view files and directories with single key commands. The
    pull-down menus make changing the date/time stamp or file
    attributes easy. Files can be tagged by directory, filename, date/
    time, file attributes, entire logical hard drive, or any combination of
    these items. Once selected as a group, you can mass copy, print, sort,
    delete, or move these files from directory to directory or disk to disk.
    
    Temporarily shell to DOS, or execute any .COM, .EXE, or .BAT file on
    your drive from within TREETOP. The user-installable setup provides a
    means for entering the name of your favorite text editor so TREETOP can
    automatically run your editor when you choose to edit a file.
