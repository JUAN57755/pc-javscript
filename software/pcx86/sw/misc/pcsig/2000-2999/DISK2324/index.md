## Information about "ULTRASEARCH"

    ULTRASEARCH is a search and editing tool that is easier to use than
    dBASE III, and gives you more capabilities than simple searches.
    
    With ULTRASEARCH you can do a fast full text search of the data in any
    .DBF format file, construct a subfile of just the data you need, and
    tailor the screen displays to meet your needs.
    
    Editing and adding records is simple. You don't even need to have
    dBASE loaded. The edit commands can be displayed on the screen for
    easy reference, and each user can adjust the editing commands with a
    couple of key strokes to fit their preferences. With full function
    editing, do any file maintenance necessary including flagging records
    for deletion.
    
    ULTRASEARCH allows you to distribute your database throughout your
    organization without obtaining multiple copies of dBASE. Since it uses
    the same file format, you can use this program to add and
    maintain records in the database.
