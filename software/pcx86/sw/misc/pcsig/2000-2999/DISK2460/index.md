## Information about "W - THE NOTE WRITER"

    Originally designed for use by handicapped persons, W - THE NOTE
    WRITER, is a quick and easy way for anyone to write a letter.  No fancy
    frills, just type your letter (any number of pages), and print.
    
    Like most word processors, W - THE NOTE WRITER, includes wordwrap,
    standard cursor movement commands, paragraph reformatting, printing, and
    document storage.  But unlike most word processors, it stops there.  No
    complex commands to get lost in, no fancy key combinations to press;
    just type and print.  The perfect program for anyone who wants to dash
    off a quick letter or for someone who has trouble with the complex word
    processors or keyboards.
