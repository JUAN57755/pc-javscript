## Information about "GOLF SCOREKEEPER"

    If it were just you and three close friends going out to the links once
    a week for a game of golf, keeping track of everyone's score would be
    easy. But if the rest of the men and women in your department, or the
    members of your club, found out about your weekends on the local
    courses, scorekeeping could get to be a burden. If this nightmare has
    come true, there's no need to sell your clubs for a skiing outfit.  Now
    there's GOLF SCOREKEEPER.
    
    Some of the features of GOLF SCOREKEEPER are:  The ability to record an
    unlimited number of players and courses in its definition area; Player
    history reports, either full history or by course; team definition and
    scorekeeping; player and course ranking reports and a
    foursome or fivesome report generator.  All players and golf courses
    defined are maintained in RAM for fast access and are shadowed on disk
    in case of any unexpected power loss.
    
    In addition to all this, GOLF SCOREKEEPER provides pull-down menus,
    special hot-keys, context-sensitive help screens and full mouse support.
    
    Probably the only thing GOLF SCOREKEEPER won't do is remind you to keep
    your head down.
