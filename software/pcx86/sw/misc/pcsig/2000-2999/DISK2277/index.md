## Information about "GRAPHIC WORKSHOP, GRAFCAT, CROPGIF"

    Need to convert .GIF or .PCX files for inclusion as halftoned art in
    desktop publishing, or use MACPAINT pictures for WORDPERFECT?  Then try
    this program -- the last word in image programs.
    
    It converts, prints, views, dithers, transforms and halftones:
    MACPAINT, GEM/VENTURA, .IMG, .GIG, .TIFF, .WPG, .MSP, and .ESP files.
    Batch processing is featured if you need to convert many files.
    Extended and expanded memory are supported.  It has an intuitive user
    interface and easy-to-follow menus.  With GRAPHIC WORKSHOP, you can
    even convert color image files into superb black and white clip art for
    desktop publishing.
    
    Other features:
    
    ~ Rotate image files in 90  increments.
    
    ~ Flip image files horizontally and vertically.
    
    ~ Print to most laser and dot matrix printers.
    
    ~ Support for .IFF/.LBM files allows pictures which originate in Amiga
    and Deluxe Paint files to be converted into more common PC formats.
    
    Print a visual catalog of your image files, sixteen to a page.  Drive
    all LaserJet and PostScript laser printers, and work with any mixture
    of.GIF, .MAC, and .IMG files.
    
    Crop smaller fragments out of your .GIF files. Use the GRAPHIC
    WORKSHOP to convert other formats into .GIF files for cropping.
    CROPGIF uses a simple mouse interface to make cropping image fragments
    no more complicated than using a paint program.
