## Information about "DPROG"

    DPROG, a dBase III programming tool, creates programs and writes user
    manuals from your screen designs. A "must have" program for anyone
    who uses (or wants to use) dBase III or Clipper.
    
    DPROG is a cluster of three programs controlled by a main menu. DPROG
    is a screen designer, the heart of the system. Simply draw the screen
    exactly as you want it, identify the fields (also very simple), and
    everything else is automatic. DPCOMP takes the screen layout you have
    created and produces all of the needed dBase III files. Then DPDOC
    prints out a 30-page step-by-step guide to your new database system.
    
    DPROG is extremely easy to use and it produces impressive results while
    requiring very little knowledge of dBase. The step-by-step
