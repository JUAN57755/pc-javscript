## Information about "KID PAINT"

    KID PAINT is an electronic coloring book, with a few added surprises,
    that is certain to keep any child entertained. Choose from a palette
    of colors and use a mouse, a joystick, or the keyboard arrow keys,
    instead of the more conventional crayons or fingerpaints. Throughout
    the coloring session, children will enjoy background music and at
    certain intervals, the pictures become animated. The simple concept is
    executed so beautifully that even a two-year-old can use it. All
    that's needed is a little eye/hand coordination and some imagination. A
    great way to introduce small children to the computer.
