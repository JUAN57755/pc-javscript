## Information about "THE LAND 1 OF 2 (ALSO 2159)"

    A fantasy role-playing game based on the book "The Chronicles of Thomas
    Covenant."  Choose from six character classes, and explore towns,
    villages, and dungeons in search of treasure and magic.
    
    Buy and trade armor, weapons, food, or magic items from the townspeople,
    who sometimes have helpful hints about the game.  Mapping is simple in
    THE LAND since the program does it for you. As you search a town, a
    dungeon, or the outside world, an overhead view shows where you are,
    and how much is left to explore of that region.
    
    You can save your game at any time -- handy if you are about to do
    battle with a dragon, or Hydra.  Like Ultima and Questron this game will
    take you many hours to complete as your character gains experience and
    knowledge in the place called THE LAND.
