## Information about "SYSTEM GUARDIAN PACKAGE"

    SYSTEM GUARDIAN PACKAGE consists of SYSGUARD, ATTRIB, and EXECHECK,
    three programs which help keep your files safe from disaster.
    
    Activate SYSGUARD and these potentially destructive
    commands cannot be performed: 1) disk format (including
    diskcopy); 2) disk write which bypasses DOS; 3) removal of a files
    read-only attribute; and 4) write to a read-only file.  If any of these
    actions are attempted, a message is displayed and the operation is
    prevented from taking place.  A simple command deactivates SYSGUARD and
    you again have access to any of the above actions.  SYSGUARD is an
    efficient terminate-stay-resident program using only 1K of RAM and can
    be used alongside other TSR programs.
    
    ATTRIB allows you to change the attribute of your files to read only,
    hidden, system, or archive.  ATTRIB is similar to the DOS ATTRIB command
    but includes the capability to change attributes to hidden or system.
    Use ATTRIB to make your program files read only, so SYSGUARD can keep
    them safe from sabotage.
    
    EXECHECK, available only to registered users, searches for .EXE programs
    that may have been patched or contaminated with a virus.  If discovered,
    EXECHECK can attempt removal of the virus.
