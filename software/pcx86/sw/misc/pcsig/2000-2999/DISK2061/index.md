## Information about "PAINLESS ACCT 3 OF 3 (2059,2060)"

    If you are looking for a full-featured accounting program, then
    PAINLESS ACCOUNTING may be your program. It is like Dac Easy
    Accounting in the way the account numbers are used and in the way the
    menus are laid out. On the other hand, PAINLESS ACCOUNTING is more
    business oriented than Dac Easy Light, which is good for those small
    businesses looking for an inexpensive accounting program.
    
    Once PAINLESS is installed, the program is easy to use with pull-down
    menus and help available. The F1 key is used for context-sensitive
    help, which is always just specific enough to be useful.
    
    PAINLESS ACCOUNTING can be recommended to those looking for a good
    package to perform ledger, billing, accounts receivable, payables and
    purchase order work, providing that they have some background knowledge
    in accounting. For those acquainted with Dac Easy it will be a simple
    task to set up the chart of accounts. For all others it is suggested
    that the sample accounts be used and printed out and then studied.
    Nevertheless, the program will meet the business needs of the
    self-employed and small businesses everywhere.
