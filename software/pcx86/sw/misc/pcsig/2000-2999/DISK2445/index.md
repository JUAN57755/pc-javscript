## Information about "BACKREM"

    Do you back up your hard drive as often as you should?  Like most
    computer users, you've probably been putting it off for months and would
    face heavy losses if your hard drive should crash tomorrow.  You need a
    way to keep on your back-up schedule.
    
    BACKREM reminds you when it's time to do a back-up, and then it runs the
    program.  Just tell BACKREM how often you want the back-up to occur
    (e.g., every 5 days) and place it in your autoexec.bat file.  On days
    you don't have to do a back-up, a message lets you know how many days
    have gone by since the last one.  On the actual back-up day, BACKREM
    gives you the choice of doing the back-up or waiting until next time.
    If you need to do a back-up off schedule, you can make BACKREM run at
    any time. For those who need several copies to secure sensitive data,
    BACKREM allows up to five copies of the same back-up to be created at a
    time. BACKREM is a must for people who want to be sure to keep their
    data safe.
