## Information about "CD DOT CHALLENGE"

    CD DOT CHALLENGE is an easy-to-play game with over 75,000 different
    game variations.  As easy as it is to play, it requires great strategy
    to win and is very addictive!
    
    The game board consists of a grid of dots.  The object of the game is
    simple... to draw a line between any two dots.  Each time a player draws
    a line that "closes" a square, that player earns a point and another
    turn.  As simple as this sounds, the strategy can be quite complex!
