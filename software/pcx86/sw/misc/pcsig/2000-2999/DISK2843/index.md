If you tend to make long distance telephone calls during periods of     
computer use, CODE-BLUE (CB) might be able to save you some of those    
annoying telephone company directory assistance fees!                   
                                                                        
CODE-BLUE is an on-line telephone area code reference system.  No       
documentation is provided, or needed, with this system.  It lets you    
cursor-select a state and get its telephone area code.  For larger      
states, CB breaks down the area code listings to the city level.  These 
city listings tend to include all the major population centers, but for 
area codes of smaller cities you will still have to call long distance  
information.
