## Information about "4ZIP, 4EDIT & XDIR"

    4ZIP is a utility for 4DOS.  Used with the PKWare file-compression
    program PKZIP, it save 4DOS file descriptions along with the files as
    they are compressed.  The included program 4UNZIP, calls PKUnzip, and
    restores the descriptions to 4DOS as each file is uncompressed.
    Select files to Zip or Unzip from a full-screen list with extended
    wildcards, like 4DOS. Works with all versions of 4DOS.  Also look at
    companion utility, 4EDIT.
    
    4EDIT is a full-screen editor for 4DOS file descriptions. It is much
    more convenient than the 4DOS DESCRIBE command because you can see the
    descriptions for all selected files at one time. Create or edit
    descriptions for any grouping of files using multiple filenames and
    extended wildcards, like 4DOS. Works with all versions of 4DOS.
    Look for the companion utility, 4ZIP also.
    
    XDIR is a commented directory utility. It displays a 65-character
    comment for each file in the DIR display. You can copy, rename and move
    files, carrying the comment line along. Run programs from the
    directory list and support executable extensions. With proper setup, it
    will recognize the appropriate application to call for a given file
    extension.
