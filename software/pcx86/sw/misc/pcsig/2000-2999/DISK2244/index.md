## Information about "QUICK CALCULATORS"

    Get four memory-resident calculators for the price of one with QUICK
    CALCULATORS: a powerful algebraic calculator, a programmer's
    calculator, a scientific calculator, and a financial calculator! Get
    them all in one program in as little as 10K of RAM with programmable
    hot keys.
    
    The programmer's calculator allows you to enter values in either
    binary, octal, decimal, or hex formats and automatically convert these
    values to the other number systems.
    
    The scientific calculator has access to 31 functions such as inverse
    tangent, hyperbolic cosine and sine of an angle.
    
    All of the calculators have on-line help and a scrolling tape that can
    hold up to 500 entries, which can be saved when you exit the program.
