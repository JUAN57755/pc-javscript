You can probably find most or all of these disks on other software sites now, just as software from
many other sites has found its way here, thanks to the Brownian motion of bits on the Internet.

Any other disks you see [below](#directory-listings) are primarily ones that don't neatly fit into another PCjs category,
usually either because the disks contain a mixture of random/personal/unique content.

> NOTES: This was originally an MS-DOS 3.20 Distribution Disk (Disk 2 of 2) which I had subsequently modified for
personal use.  Presumably to make more room on the disk, I had moved off a few MS-DOS 3.20 files (BACKUP.EXE,
RESTORE.EXE, SHARE.EXE, TREE.EXE, and XCOPY.EXE), updated DEBUG.EXE, added MASM.EXE (v4.00), and then included
a few files of my own (eg, PCPAL.EXE and HDISK.ASM).  FYI, this particular copy of PCPAL.EXE was saved with **Alt-Esc**
configured as the activation key sequence. *--[@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com)*
