NOTE: I suspect the dump of the tape containing this machine-language program is either damaged or incomplete, which is unfortunate,
because these were a nice set of [Enhancements and Patches](#handwritten-notes-on-osi-basic-enhancements) that I had created around 1980-1981
for the Microsoft BASIC Interpreter that came with the OSI Challenger 1P.  Hopefully I'll find time to dig into this again and figure what
the problem is.
