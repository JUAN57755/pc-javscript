DiskDump is a Node [module](lib/diskdump.js) with both a command-line [utility](bin/diskdump.js) and a web server API for converting the contents of binary files to JSON.

NOTE: DiskDump has been superseded by the [DiskImage](../../../diskimage/) utility.  See [PCjs Tools](../../../) for more information.
