FileDump is a Node [module](lib/filedump.js) with both a command-line [utility](bin/filedump.js) and a web server API for converting the contents of binary files to JSON.

NOTE: FileDump has been superseded by the [FileImage](../../../fileimage/) utility.  See [PCjs Tools](../../../) for more information.
