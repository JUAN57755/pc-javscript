Last week, I was sifting through some old email, looking for any interesting references to `HIMEM` and `A20`,
and I almost overlooked this short note I had written 30+ years ago:

    From jeffpar Tue Dec  1 10:26:36 1987
    To: scottsc
    Cc: jeffpar
    Subject: Re: A20.COM
    Date: Tue Dec 01 10:32:43 1987
    
    When Nancy and company were doing automated (ie, sgrab) testing of the
    OS/2 3xbox, keystrokes were getting dropped and duplicated.  The problem
    stems from OS/2's constant mode-switching (from real-mode to protected-mode
    and back), and the constant disabling and re-enabling of the A20 line.
    Since OS/2 has to talk to the keyboard controller to do that, it was inter-
    fering with data coming into the keyboard controller occasionally.  (I still
    don't know why this never happens with IBM keyboards;  non-IBM keyboards
    and sgrab are the only culprits).
    
    A20.COM just patches the OS/2 kernel so that it stops fiddling with the
    keyboard controller to change A20 state, and then enables A20.  Since the
    currently loaded image of OS/2 won't be changing A20 anymore, A20 should
    remain permanently enabled.  This will cause some compatibility problems
    for apps that rely on the 1meg wrap, which includes apps that use the old
    "call 5" interface to make DOS calls, but the only one I've run across so far
    is Word's SPELL utility.

    | Thanks. Just for curiousity's sake, what is it that A20.com is supposed to
    | do? Nancys made it sound like it activated some interrupt or another, but she
    | didn't really know. Other people have told me it has to do with timing.
    | What's the real reason for running this program?
 
I barely noticed the last sentence:

    This will cause some compatibility problems for apps that rely on the 1meg wrap,
    which includes apps that use the old "call 5" interface to make DOS calls, but
    the only one I've run across so far is Word's SPELL utility.

Recently, a handful of people, like Michal over at the
[OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/a-word-on-the-call-5-spell/), and myself, had been looking
for examples of old software that used the CP/M-style "CALL 5" interface to DOS, instead of (or in addition to)
the "INT 21h" interface.

Here was a prime example, [SPELL.COM](#break-the-spell), that I had found 30 years ago and completely forgotten
about.

And what about that `A20` program, you ask?  I found a copy of that, too.  The `PRO386` was probably the cheap
80386-based PC clone I had bought in 1987, which had a few issues running OS/2.  Hence this utility, which apparently
I later adapted to help resolve an issue with OS/2 compatibility testing.

    ;       Purpose is to patch standard ROM (actually the copy

    ;
    ;       Will also check for OS/2 running (real-mode version >= 10)
    ;       and search for, and disable through additional patching, the

### Break The SPELL

So, for your debugging pleasure, I've set up an IBM PC (Model 5160)
to demonstrate Microsoft's `SPELL.COM` use of "CALL 5".  It's configured as follows:

    id: ibm5160
    type: pcx86
    debugger: true
    uncompiled: true
    commands: bp &060E:0005 "dh;h"
    config: /devices/pcx86/machine/5160/ega/640kb/debugger/machine.xml
    autoMount:
      A:
        name: PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 1)
      B:
        name: MS Word 3.00 (Disk 2)
    autoType: $date\r$time\rB:\rSPELL\r

This establishes a breakpoint on the "CALL 5" entry point inside the application's Program Segment Prefix (PSP);
the breakpoint dumps the previous 10 instructions and then halts.  The "uncompiled" version of PCx86 is being used
so that [BackTrack]({{ site.github.pages }}/machines/pcx86/#backtrack-support)&trade; information is available to the PCjs Debugger.
You can use the command `BC *` to clear all predefined breakpoints and allow the program to run normally.

To start the machine, click "Run" or use the Debugger's `G` command.

{% include machine.html id="ibm5160" %}

And if all this seems like much ado about nothing, well, then put your feet up for a few and enjoy Nina Simone's
"[I Put a Spell on You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Put_a_Spell_on_You)", which hit #23 on the
U.S. Billboard R&B chart in 1965.  That way, your time here won't be *completely* wasted.
