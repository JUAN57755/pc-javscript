I was playing with different video modes using an [IBM PC AT w/EGA](/machines/pcx86/ibm/5170/ega/640kb/rev1/machine.xml)
and I discovered an odd problem.  NOTE: In the machine below, you can also switch control to the TestMonitor window using
the "CTTY COM2" DOS command and then type the TestMonitor's "mode0e" command to replicate the SYMDEB sequence described below.

{% include machine.html id="ibm5170" %}

For example, when I ran this code:

	C:\>SYMDEB
    -a
    1962:0100  mov ax,e
    1962:0103  int 10
    1962:0105  int 3
    1962:0106  
    -g

the following "text" correctly appeared at the top of the screen, in 640x200 16-color graphics mode 0x0E:

    AX=0B01  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=E58D  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000  
    DS=1962  ES=1962  SS=1962  CS=1962  IP=0105   NV UP EI PL NZ NA PO NC 
    1962:0105 CC             INT    3                                  
    -

And when I typed "q", then "cls" and finally "dir", the screen filled with DOS directory contents.

But as soon as the screen started to scroll, the screen contents became garbled.  Other EGA graphics modes,
like 640x350 16-color mode 0x10, didn't have this problem.

To investigate, I set a breakpoint in the IBM EGA ROM where the scrolling starts, at 0xC000:12EA (see p.130 of the
"IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter" Technical Reference document):

	CRANK_A:
		PUSH    CX
		MOV     CL,DL
		SUB     CH,CH
		PUSH    SI
		PUSH    DI
		REP     MOVSB   
		POP     DI
		POP     SI
		ADD     SI,BX
		ADD     DI,BX
		POP     CX
		LOOP    CRANK_A

CX contains 0xC0 (192), which is the number of scan-lines to move up, and BX contains 0x50 (80), the number
of bytes per scan-line.

When the breakpoint was hit, I dumped the video hardware state, using the Debugger's "*d video*" command.
For comparison purposes, I've pasted the corresponding video state for mode 0x10 on the right-hand side.

One of the apparent oddities is that, for mode 0x0E, the GRC Mode Register was programmed with 0x11, whereas
for mode 0x10, it was programmed with 0x00.  Why would mode 0x0E want to set the ODDEVEN bit during the scroll,
when it hadn't been set during any other writes to the screen?

At this point, I dumped the instruction history buffer a bit ("*dh 100*"), and noticed this GRC write:

	C000:1582 8BC5            MOV      AX,BP                ;history=33
	C000:1584 B603            MOV      DH,03                ;history=32
	C000:1586 B2CE            MOV      DL,CE                ;history=31
	C000:1588 E88AF7          CALL     0D15                 ;history=30
	C000:0D15 86C4            XCHG     AL,AH                ;history=29
	C000:0D17 EE              OUT      DX,AL                ;history=28
	C000:0D18 42              INC      DX                   ;history=27
	C000:0D19 86C4            XCHG     AL,AH                ;history=26
	C000:0D1B EE              OUT      DX,AL                ;history=25
	C000:0D1C 4A              DEC      DX                   ;history=24

So I looked farther back and saw where BP was set:

	C000:1522 BA00A0          MOV      DX,A000              ;history=97
	C000:1525 BD1105          MOV      BP,0511              ;history=96

Here's the complete function:

	GR_ST_1:
		MOV     DX,A000
		MOV     BP,0511
		CMP     AH,0F
		JC      1535
		CALL    14F7
		JNC     1535
		MOV     BP,0501
		RET     

OK, so any (EGA) graphics mode below 0x0F is going to the trigger the use of Write Mode 1 with the ODDEVEN bit set.
And sure enough, the scrolling bug also occurs when using 320x200 16-color mode 0x0D.

It's also worth noting that, whenever the ODDEVEN bit of the GRC Mode Register is set, the SEQUENTIAL bit in the Sequencer
Memory Mode Register is supposed to be clear (and vice versa -- those two bits are supposed to always be oppositely set).
But here, the IBM EGA BIOS hasn't done that.  One wonders if that was a mistake....

Another bit of trivia: while dumping the frame buffer in a VGA text mode in a different emulator, I discovered that
when I turned off the ODDEVEN bit in the GRC Mode Register, odd bytes would still appear from plane 1; it wasn't until I
*also* turned off the CHAIN bit in the GRC Miscellaneous Register that the odd bytes would no longer appear.  But,
that could have just been an idiosyncrasy of that particular emulator.

As a result of all these observations, and more importantly, to make EGA scrolling work properly in modes 0x0D and 0x0E,
I've changed the Video component to use odd/even memory functions *only* when the SEQUENTIAL bit (bit 2) of the
Sequencer's Memory Mode Register is clear, instead of relying on the ODDEVEN bit (bit 4) of the Graphics Controller's Mode
Register.

To be continued....  because I've barely scratched the surface of all the side-effects of EGA/VGA odd/even addressing,
and I hope to do some testing on real hardware in the near future.
